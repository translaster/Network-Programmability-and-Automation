# About the Authors

Matt Oswalt is a software engineer with a specific focus on distributed systems and
internet/web protocols. He enjoys the challenge of working with large systems that
require efficient, resilient design—both at scale and close to the metal. You can find
him writing about his latest explorations at oswalt.dev.

Christian Adell is a network software engineer who has played multiple roles related
to networking and IT automation. Currently, as principal architect at Network to
Code, he is focused on building network automation solutions for diverse use cases,
with great emphasis on open source software. He is passionate about learning and
helping others to be happier, but also has more hobbies than hours in the day, so
working remotely from Barcelona gives him the time and the space to achieve his
dreams. He can be found on Twitter as @chadell0.

Scott S. Lowe works on the Developer Relations team at Pulumi Corporation. He
currently focuses on cloud computing and IaC after having spent a number of years
specializing in compute and network virtualization. Scott has authored several tech‐
nical books over the course of his career, and shares technical content regularly on his
blog at blog.scottlowe.org. He lives with his wife in Denver, Colorado, but they dream
of living somewhere with white sand beaches and crystal clear water.

Jason Edelman is the founder and CTO at Network to Code, a leading network
automation solutions provider. He founded Network to Code in 2014. Observing how
DevOps was radically changing the IT operational models for systems administrators
and developers, Jason saw an opportunity to combine existing technologies from the
worlds of DevOps and software development within the networking infrastructure
domain to create holistic network automation solutions. Prior to Network to Code,
Jason spent a career in technical sales at Presidio, BlueWater, and Cisco, developing
and architecting network solutions. He is a former CCIE and has a BE in computer
engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology. You can find Jason on Twitter at

# Colophon

The animal on the cover of Network Programmability and Automation is a gavial
crocodile (Gavialis gangeticus). This reptile can be found in two countries: India,
along the Chambal, Girwa, and Son Rivers; and Nepal, along the Narayani River. The
gavial’s name originated from the knob of tissue that grows on the tip of the male’s
snout called a ghara, the Hindi word for pot.

The gavial is easily distinguishable from other crocodiles because of its long, slender
snout and narrow, sharp teeth. It feeds primarily on small fish and crustaceans. It
herds fish toward the shore and stuns them using an underwater jaw clap. It does not
chew its prey but swallows it whole. This species rarely attacks humans, but with 110
interdigitated teeth, you don’t want to get too close.

This crocodile is very long, measuring 13–20 ft (4–6 m). The color ranges from olive
green to brown-gray with a light underside. It reaches maturity at 8–12 years. Males
use their gharas to vocalize and blow bubbles during mating displays. Females make
nests in the sand banks and guard the eggs for 83–94 days, then tend to the hatchlings
for several months.

The preferred habitat of the gavial is high-banked rivers with clear, fast-flowing water
and deep pools. Since the mid-1900s, the gavial’s numbers have declined as much as
98 percent because of hunting for traditional medicine and drastic changes to their
freshwater habitats.

Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to
the world.
