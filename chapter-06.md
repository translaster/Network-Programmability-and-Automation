## CHAPTER 6 Python

As a network engineer, there has never been a better time for you to learn to auto‐
mate and write code. As we noted in Chapter 1, the network industry is fundamen‐
tally changing. It is a fact that networking had not changed much from the late 1990s
to about 2010, both architecturally and operationally. In that span of time, network
engineers undoubtedly typed in the same CLI commands hundreds, if not thousands,
of times to configure and troubleshoot network devices. Why the madness?

It is specifically around the operations of a network that learning to read and write
some code starts to make sense. In fact, scripting or writing a few lines of code to
gather information on the network, or to make changes, isn’t new at all. It’s been
done for years. Some engineers took on this feat—programming in their language
of choice, learning to work with raw text using complex parsing and regular expres‐
sions, and querying SNMP MIBs in a script. If you’ve ever attempted this yourself,
you know firsthand that it’s possible, but working with regular expressions and
parsing text is time-consuming and tedious.

Luckily, things are starting to move in the right direction, and the barrier to entry
for network automation is more accessible than ever. We are seeing advances from
network vendors, but also in the open source tooling available for automating the
network, both of which we cover in this book. For example, there are now network
device APIs, vendor- and community-supported Python libraries, and freely available
open source tools that give you and every other network engineer access to a growing
ecosystem to jump-start your network automation journey. This ultimately means
that you have to write less code than you would have in the past, and less code means
faster development and fewer bugs.

Before we dive into the basics of Python, we’ll consider one more important question
because it always comes up in conversations among network engineers: should net‐
work engineers learn to code?

#### Should Network Engineers Learn to Code?

Unfortunately, you aren’t getting a definitive yes or no from us. Clearly, we have a full chapter on Python and another on Go, and plenty of examples throughout the book on how to use Python or Go to communicate to network devices via network APIs
and extend DevOps tools like Ansible and Terraform, so we definitely think learning the basics of any programming language is valuable. We also think it’ll become an even more valuable skill as the network and IT industries continue to transform at such a rapid pace, and we happen to think Python is a pretty great first choice.

We consider Python a great first choice when it comes to network
automation for several reasons. First, Python is a dynamically
typed language that allows you to create and use Python objects
(such as variables and functions) where and when needed, meaning
they don’t need to be defined before you start using them. This
simplifies getting started. Second, Python is also super readable.
It’s common to see conditional statements like if device in
device_list:, and in that statement, you can easily decipher that
we are simply checking to see if a device is in a particular list of
devices. Another reason is that network vendors and open source
projects are building a great set of libraries and tools using Python.
This just adds to the benefit of learning to program with Python.

The real question, though, is should every network engineer know how to read and
write a basic script? The answer is a definite yes. Now should every network engineer
become a software developer? Absolutely not. Many engineers will gravitate more
toward one discipline than the next, and maybe some network engineers do transi‐
tion to become developers, but all types of engineers, not just network engineers,
should not fear trying to read through some Python or Ruby, or even more advanced
languages like C, Go, or Rust. System administrators have done fairly well already
with using scripting as a tool to allow them to do their jobs more efficiently by using
bash scripts, Python, Ruby, and PowerShell.

On the other hand, this hasn’t been the case for network administrators (which is
a major reason for this book!). As the industry progresses and engineers evolve, it’s realistic for you, as a network engineer, to be more DevOps oriented, in that you end up somewhere in the middle—not as a developer, but also not as a traditional CLI-only network engineer. You could end up using open source configuration management and automation tools and then add a little code as necessary (and if needed) to accomplish and automate the workflows and tasks in your specific environment.

Unless your organization warrants it based on size, scale, compli‐
ance, or control, it’s not common or recommended to write custom
software for everything and build a home-grown automation plat‐
form. It’s not an efficient use of time. We do recommend that you
understand the components involved in programming, software
development, and especially fundamentals such as core data types
that are common to all tools and languages, as we cover in this
chapter focused on Python.

So we know the industry is changing, devices have APIs, and it makes sense to start
the journey to learn to write some code. This chapter provides you with the building
blocks to go from 0 to 70 as you start your Python journey. Throughout the rest of
this chapter, we start with the basics of Python (e.g., data types and flow logic), and
then explore more advanced topics such as functions, classes, modules, and other
patterns.

Get ready—you are about to jump in and learn some Python!

This chapter’s sole focus is to introduce foundational Python con‐
cepts to network engineers looking to learn Python to augment
their existing skill sets. It is not intended to provide an exhaus‐
tive education for full-time developers to write production-quality
Python software. A useful book to go deeper on Python is Fluent
Python by Luciano Ramalho (O’Reilly).

Additionally, the concepts covered in this chapter are heavily rel‐
evant outside the scope of Python. For example, you must under‐
stand concepts like loops and data types—which we explore here—
to work with tools like Ansible, Nornir, and Terraform.

Finally, once you finish this chapter, you might realize that we
didn’t explore many real-world network automation use cases.
This is intentional; as with any programming language, sometimes
entire books are often not enough to cover even the basics, and
we aim to give a sufficient foundation for our purposes in a single
chapter. So, in this chapter we focus solely on this foundation.
Chapter 10 then revisits many of these concepts to tackle some
real-world network automation tasks.

Using the Python Interactive Interpreter

The Python interactive interpreter isn’t always known by those just starting out to learn to program or even those who have been developing in other languages, but
it is a tool that everyone should know and learn before trying to create standalone executable scripts.

The interpreter is instrumental to developers of all experience levels. This tool, also commonly known as the Python shell, is used as a learning platform for beginners, but it’s also used by the most experienced developers to test and get real-time feedback without having to write a full program or script.

The Python shell, or interpreter, is found on nearly all native Linux distributions
as well as many of the more modern network OSs from vendors including, but not
limited to, Cisco, HPE, Juniper, Cumulus, and Arista. To access the Python interactive
interpreter, you simply open a Linux terminal window, or SSH to a modern network
device, type in the command python3, and hit Enter.

All examples throughout this chapter that denote a Linux terminal
command start with $. While you’re at the Python shell, all lines
and commands start with >>>. Additionally, all the examples are
from a system running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Python 3.8.12.

Since the first version of this book was published, Python 2.7 has
reached End of Life. As a result, this chapter now exclusively uses
Python 3 syntax and libraries.

For an explicit usage of Python 3 across the book, we use python3
to run Python scripts and launch the interactive interpreter, disam‐
biguating with the python alias, which could still be pointing to
Python 2.

After entering the python3 command and hitting Enter, you are taken directly into
the shell. While in the shell, you start writing Python code immediately! There is no
text editor, no IDE, and no prerequisites to getting started:

$ python3
Python 3.8.12 (default, Feb 26 2022, 00:05:23)
[GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Although we jump into much more detail on Python throughout this chapter, we’ll
take a quick look at a few examples right now to see the power of the Python
interpreter. Let’s start by simply creating a variable called hostname and assigning it
the value of ROUTER_1:

>>> hostname = 'ROUTER_1'

Notice that you do not need to declare the variable first or define that hostname is
going to be of type string. This is a departure from some programming languages
such as C and Java, and a reason Python is called a dynamic language.

Now, you can print the variable hostname:

>>> print(hostname)
ROUTER_1
>>>
>>> hostname
'ROUTER_1'

Once you’ve created the variable, you can easily print it using the print command,
but while in the shell, you can also display the value of hostname or any variable by
just typing in the name of the variable and pressing Enter. One difference between
these two methods is that when you use the print statement, characters such as the
end of line, or EOL (\n), are interpreted, but are not when you’re not using the print
statement.

For example, using print interprets the \n and a new line is printed, but when you’re
just typing the variable name into the shell and hitting Enter, the \n is not interpreted
and is just displayed to the terminal:

>>> banner = "\n  WELCOME TO ROUTER_1  \n"
>>>
>>> print(banner)

WELCOME TO ROUTER_1

>>>
>>> banner
'\n  WELCOME TO ROUTER_1  \n'

Can you see the difference?

When you are validating or testing, the Python shell is a great tool to use. In the
preceding examples, you may have noticed that single quotes and double quotes are
both used. Now you may be thinking, could they be used together on the same line?
Let’s not speculate about it; let’s use the Python shell to test it out:

>>> hostname = 'ROUTER_1"

File "<stdin>", line 1

hostname = 'ROUTER_1"

^

SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

And just like that, you verify that Python supports both single and double quotes, and
learn that they cannot be used together.

Most examples throughout this chapter continue to use the Python interpreter—
feel free to follow along and test them out as they’re covered. We’ll continue to
use the Python interpreter as we review Python data types, with a specific focus on
networking.

Understanding Python Data Types

This section provides an overview of various Python data types, including strings,
numbers (integers and floats), booleans, lists, and dictionaries. This section also
touches upon tuples and sets.

The content on strings, lists, and dictionaries is broken into two parts. The first is
an introduction to the data type and the second covers some of its built-in methods.
As you’ll see, methods are natively part of Python, making it extremely easy for
developers to manipulate and work with each respective data type.

For example, a method called upper that takes a string and converts it to all upper‐
case letters can be executed with the statement, "router1".upper(), which returns
ROUTER1. We show many more examples of using methods throughout this chapter.

The sections on integers and booleans provide an overview to show you how to use
mathematical operators and boolean expressions while writing code in Python.

Finally, we close the section on data types by providing a brief introduction to tuples
and sets. They are more advanced data types, but we feel they were still worth
covering in an introduction to Python.

Table 6-1 describes and highlights each data type covered in this chapter. You can use
this as a reference throughout the chapter.

Let’s get started and take a look at Python strings.

Strings

Strings—a sequence of characters enclosed by quotes—are arguably the most well-
known data type in all programming languages.

Although strings look like a simple data type, they are slightly more
complex. A string can represent two kinds of data: text and bytes.
In Python 2, both types were represented as a str, but in Python 3,
each is a separate and incompatible type.

You can go deeper on the differences, but in short, in Python 2
strings are ASCII characters and in Python 3 strings are Unicode
characters (by default UTF-8), so if you receive bytes you will need
to encode them to use string methods, using one of the available
encode types, such as UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII, or others.

Earlier in the chapter, we presented a few basic examples for creating variables that
were of type str. Let’s examine what else you need to know when starting to use
strings.

First, you’ll define two new variables that are both strings, final and ipaddr:

>>> final = 'The IP address of router1 is: '
>>>
>>> ipaddr = '192.0.2.1'

You can use the built-in function called type to verify the data type
of any given object in Python:

>>> type(final)
<class 'str'>

This is how you can easily check the type of one object, which
is often helpful in troubleshooting code, especially if it’s code you
didn’t write.

Next, let’s look at how to combine, add, or concatenate strings:

>>> final + ipaddr
'The IP address of router1 is: 192.0.2.1'

So far, you’ve created two new variables: final and ipaddr. Each is a string. After
both are created, you concatenate them using the + operator, and finally print them
out. Fairly easy, right?

Understanding Python Data Types
|
173


The same could be done even if final is not a predefined object:

>>> print('The IP address of router1 is: ' + ipaddr)
The IP address of router1 is: 192.0.2.1

Using built-in methods of strings

To view the available built-in methods for strings, you use the built-in dir() function
while in the Python shell. You first create any variable that is a string or use the
formal data type name of str and pass it as an argument to dir() to view the
available methods. You can always find more detailed information in the Python
official docs.

dir() can be used on any Python object, not just strings, as we
show throughout this chapter.


```
>>> dir(str)
# output has been omitted
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__doc__',
'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha',
'isdigit', 'islower', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'lower',
'lstrip', 'replace', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith',
'strip', 'upper']
```

To keep the output clean and simplify examples throughout the
chapter, we add an omitted comment in some outputs. In this
example, we’ve removed some objects that start and end with
double underscores (__), also known as dunders. These internal
methods are used to implement some magic operations without
explicitly calling them.

For instance, as you will see in “Understanding Python Classes” on
page 230, when an object is created from a class, there is an implicit
call to the __init__() method (the constructor) and it returns an
object. By overwriting this dunder, you can customize how your
objects will be created.

To reiterate what we said earlier, it’s possible to also pass any string to the dir()
function to produce the same output as previously. For example, if you define a
variable such as hostname = 'ROUTER', hostname can be passed to dir()—that is,
dir(hostname)—producing the same output as dir(str) to determine what meth‐
ods are available for strings.

Navigate the Code with type(), dir(), and help()

To learn how to use a given method that you see in the output of dir(), you can use
the built-in function help(). To use this built-in help feature, you pass in the object
(or variable) and the given method. The following example shows how you can use
help() to learn how to use the upper method:

>>> help(hostname.upper)
Help on built-in function upper:

upper() method of builtins.str instance

Return a copy of the string converted to uppercase.

(END)

When you’re finished, press Q to quit viewing the built-in help.

At this point, we have already introduced the three functions that will help you gain
more understanding of your code. Here is our recommended flow:

1. Check your data type by using type().
1.

2. Check the available methods for your object by using dir().
2.

3. After knowing which method you want to use, learn how to use it by using
3.

help().

Let’s take a look at several of the string methods, including count(), endswith(),
startswith(), format(), isdigit(), join(), lower(), upper(), and strip().

As we review each method, you should be asking yourself two key questions. What
value is returned from the method? And what action is the method performing on
the original object?

Using the upper() and lower() methods.    Using the upper() and lower() methods is
helpful when you need to compare strings that do not need to be case-sensitive.
For example, maybe you need to accept a variable that is the name of an interface
such as Ethernet1/1, but want to also allow the user to enter ethernet1/1. The best
way to compare these is to use upper() or lower():

>>> interface = 'Ethernet1/1'
>>>
>>> interface.lower()
'ethernet1/1'
>>>
>>> interface.upper()
'ETHERNET1/1'

You can see that when you’re using a method, the format is to enter the object name,
or string in this case, and then append .methodname():

Understanding Python Data Types

175


• The period (.) indicates accessing a method (or an attribute) of an object.
•

• methodname is the name of the method.
•

• The parentheses, (), indicate calling the method. As you will see soon, it could
•

take arguments.

Next, after executing interface.lower(), notice that ethernet1/1 is printed to
the terminal. This is telling you that ethernet1/1 was returned when lower() was
executed. The same holds true for upper(). When something is returned, you also
have the ability to assign it as the value to a new or existing variable:

>>> intf_lower = interface.lower()
>>>
>>> print(intf_lower)
ethernet1/1

In this example, you can see how to use the method, but also assign the data being
returned to a variable.

What about the original variable called interface? Let’s see what, if anything,
changed with interface:

>>> print(interface)
Ethernet1/1

Since you are exploring the first examples, it still may not be clear what you’re looking
for to see if something changed in the original variable interface, but you do
know that it still holds the value of Ethernet1/1, which hasn’t changed. Don’t worry,
you’ll see plenty of examples of when the original object is modified throughout this
chapter.

Using the startswith() and endswith() methods.    As you can probably guess, starts
with() is used to verify whether a string starts with a certain sequence of characters,
and endswith() is used to verify whether a string ends with a certain sequence of
characters:

>>> ipaddr = '10.100.20.5'
>>>
>>> ipaddr.startswith('10')
True
>>>
>>> ipaddr.startswith('100')
False
>>>
>>> ipaddr.endswith('.5')
True

The lower() and upper() methods return a string, which is a modified string with
all lowercase or uppercase letters. However, startswith() and endswith() do not

176
|
Chapter 6: Python


return a string, but rather a boolean (bool) object. As you’ll learn later in this chapter,
boolean values are True and False. The startswith() method returns True if the
sequence of characters being passed in matches the respective starting or ending
sequence of the object. Otherwise, it returns False.

For the boolean values True and False, no quotes are used, and the
first letter must be capitalized. Booleans are covered in more detail
later in the chapter.

Using these methods proves to be valuable when you’re looking to verify the start or
end of a string. Maybe you want to verify the first or fourth octet of an IPv4 address
or verify an interface name, as you did in the previous example using lower(). Rather
than assume that a user of a script is going to enter the full name, it’s advantageous to
do a check on the first two characters to allow the user to input ethernet1/1, eth1/1,
or et1/1.

For this check you’ll combine methods, or use the return value of one method as the
base string object for the second method:

>>> interface = 'Eth1/1'
>>>
>>> interface.lower().startswith('et')
True

You verify that it is an Ethernet interface by first executing lower(), which returns
eth1/1, and then the boolean check is performed to see whether eth1/1 starts with
et. And, clearly, it does.

Of course, other parts could be invalid beyond the eth in an interface string object,
but the point is that methods can be easily used together.

Using the strip() method.    Some legacy network devices still don’t have APIs. If you
want to write a script, it’s plausible that at some point you’ll try it out on an older
CLI-based device. If you do this, you’ll be sure to encounter globs of raw text coming
back from the device—this could be the result of any show command from the output
of show interfaces to a full show running-config.

When you need to store or simply print something, you may not want any whitespace
wrapping the object you want to use or see. To be consistent with previous examples,
let’s say this is an IP address.

What if the object you’re working with has the value of " 10.1.50.1 " including
the whitespace. The methods startswith() or endswith() don’t work because of the
spaces. For these situations, you use strip() to remove the whitespace:

Understanding Python Data Types
|
177


>>> ipaddr = '   10.1.50.1   '
>>>
>>> ipaddr.strip()
'10.1.50.1'

Using strip() returns the object without any spaces on both sides. Examples aren’t
shown for lstrip() or rstrip(), but they are two other built-in methods for
strings that remove whitespace specifically on the left or right side of a string object,
respectively.

Using the isdigit() method.    While working with strings, you’ll need to verify that the
string object is a number at times. Technically, integers are a different data type
(covered in the next section), but numbers can still be values in strings.

Using isdigit() makes it extremely straightforward to see whether the character or
string is actually a digit:

>>> ten = '10'
>>>
>>> ten.isdigit()
True
>>>
>>> bogus = '10a'
>>>
>>> bogus.isdigit()
False

Just as with startswith(), isdigit() also returns a boolean. It returns True if the
value is an integer; otherwise, it returns False.

Using the count() method.    Imagine working with a binary number—maybe it’s to
calculate an IP address or subnet mask. Although some built-in libraries can do
binary-to-decimal conversion, what if you just want to count how many 1s or 0s are
in a given string? You can use count() to do this for you:

>>> octet = '11111000'
>>>
>>> octet.count('1')
5

This example shows how easy it is to use count(). This method, however, returns an
int (integer), unlike any of the previous examples.

When using count(), you are not limited to sending a single character as a parameter
either:

>>> octet.count('111')
1
>>>
>>> test_string = "Don't you wish you started programming a little earlier?"
>>>

178

Chapter 6: Python


>>> test_string.count('you')
2

Using the format() method.    You saw earlier how to concatenate strings. Imagine need‐
ing to create a sentence, or better yet, a command to send to a network device that
is built from several strings or variables. How would you format the string, or CLI
command?

Let’s use ping as an example and assume that the command you need to create is the
following:

ping 8.8.8.8 vrf management

The examples in this chapter use generic network CLI commands,
as no actual device connections are being made. Thus, they map
to no specific vendor and are the de facto “industry standard”
examples that work on various systems including Cisco IOS, Cisco
NXOS, Arista EOS, and many others.

If you were writing a script from the preceding command, you could identify two
variables: '8.8.8.8' (the IP address) and management (the VRF name). These vari‐
ables can become user-input parameters that change at every execution.

One way to build the string is to start with the following:

>>> ipaddr = '8.8.8.8'
>>> vrf = 'management'
>>>
>>> ping = 'ping' + ipaddr + 'vrf' + vrf
>>>
>>> print(ping)
ping8.8.8.8vrfmanagement

You see the spacing is incorrect, so you have two options: add spaces to your input
objects or within the ping object. Let’s try adding them within ping:

>>> ping = 'ping' + ' ' + ipaddr + ' ' + 'vrf ' + vrf
>>>
>>> print(ping)
ping 8.8.8.8 vrf management

As you can see, this works quite well and is not too complicated, but as the strings or
commands get longer, dealing with all the quotes and spaces can get messy. Using the
format() method can simplify this:

>>> ping = 'ping {} vrf {}'.format(ipaddr, vrf)
>>>
>>> print(ping)
ping 8.8.8.8 vrf management

Understanding Python Data Types
|
179


The format() method takes multiple arguments, which are inserted between the
curly braces ({}) found within the string. Notice that format() is being used on a raw
string, unlike in the previous examples.

It’s possible to use any of the string methods on both variables or
raw strings. This is true for any other data type and its built-in
methods as well.

The next example shows using the format() method with a pre-created string object
(variable), in contrast to the previous example:

>>> ping = 'ping {} vrf {}'
>>>
>>> command = ping.format(ipaddr, vrf)
>>>
>>> print(command)
ping 8.8.8.8 vrf management

This scenario is more likely, in that you would have a predefined command in
a Python script with users inputting two arguments, and the output is the final
command string that gets pushed to a network device.

Another option to concatenate strings is to use the % operator. One
example for inserting strings (s) is provided here:

>>> hostname = 'r5'
>>> interface = 'Eth1/1'
>>>
>>> test = 'Device %s has one interface: %s' % (hostname,

interface)

>>> print(test)
Device r5 has one interface: Eth1/1

Since Python 3.6, a new formatting option for strings is available: f-strings, which has
an f at the beginning of the string and uses {} to contain the expressions that will be
rendered to strings. This formatting option has gained a lot of popularity within the
Python community because it helps visualize where the variables are used:

>>> f'ping {ipaddr} vrf {vrf}'
'ping 8.8.8.8 vrf management'

When using f-strings for debugging, you can use = after the object
name to populate the name of the object rendered:

>>> f'Rendering command with: {ipaddr=} {vrf=}'
"Rendering command with: ipaddr='8.8.8.8' vrf='management'"

Chapter 6: Python


Using the join() and split() methods.    We saved join() and split() for last since they
include working with another data type called list.

Although lists are formally covered later in this chapter, we include
a brief introduction here to show the join() and split() methods
for string objects.

Lists are exactly what they sound like. They are a list of objects, and each object is
called an element. The elements in a list don’t have to be of the same data type.

In an environment with five routers, you might have a list of hostnames:

>>> hostnames = ['r1', 'r2', 'r3', 'r4', 'r5']

You can also build a list of commands to send to a network device to make a
configuration change. The next example is a list of commands to shut down an
Ethernet interface on a switch:

>>> commands = ['config t', 'interface Ethernet1/1', 'shutdown']

Building a list like this is common, but if you’re using a traditional CLI-based
network device, you might not be able to send a list object directly to the device.
The device may require strings to be sent (or individual commands).

join() is one such method that can take a list and create a string, but insert required
characters, if needed, between them.

Remember that \n is the EOL character. When sending commands to a device, you
may need to insert \n between commands to allow the device to render a new line for
the next command.

If you take commands from the previous example, you can see how to leverage join()
to create a single string with a \n inserted between each command:

>>> '\n'.join(commands)
'config t\ninterface Ethernet1/1\nshutdown'

Another practical example is when using an API such as NX-API that exists on Cisco
Nexus switches. Cisco gives the option to send a string of commands, but they need
to be separated by a semicolon (;). To do this, you use the same approach:

>>> ' ; '.join(commands)
'config t ; interface Ethernet1/1 ; shutdown'

In this example, you add a space before and after the semicolon, but it’s the same
overall approach.

Understanding Python Data Types
|
181


In these examples, a semicolon and an EOL character are used as
the separator, but you don’t need to use any characters at all. It’s
possible to concatenate the elements in the list without inserting
any characters, like this: ''.join(list_name).

You’ve learned how to use join() to create a string out of a list, but what if you need
to do the exact opposite and create a list from a string? One option is to use the
split() method.

Let’s start with the previously generated string and convert it back to a list:

>>> commands = 'config t ; interface Ethernet1/1 ; shutdown'
>>>
>>> cmds_list = commands.split(' ; ')
>>>
>>> print(cmds_list)
['config t', 'interface Ethernet1/1', 'shutdown']

This shows how simple it is to take a string object and create a list from it. Another
common example for networking is to take an IP address (string) and convert it to a
list by using split(), creating a list of four elements—one element per octet:

>>> ipaddr = '10.1.20.30'
>>>
>>> ipaddr.split('.')
['10', '1', '20', '30']

That covers the basics of working with Python strings. Let’s move on to the next data
type, which is numbers.

Numbers

In this section, we don’t spend much time on different types of numbers such as floats
(decimal numbers) or imaginary numbers (complex numbers with a zero real part),
but we do briefly look at the data type denoted as int, better known as an integer.
Frankly, this is because most people understand numbers, and there aren’t built-in
methods that make sense to cover at this point. Rather than cover built-in methods
for integers, we take a look at using mathematical operators while in the Python shell.

Decimal numbers in Python are referred to as floats. Remember,
you can always verify the data type by using the built-in function
type():

>>> cpu = 41.3
>>>
>>> type(cpu)
<class 'float'>

To add numbers, nothing fancy is needed; just add them:

>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 2
>>> a + b
3

A counter might be needed as you are looping through a sequence of objects. You
may want to say counter = 1, perform some type of operation, and then do counter
= counter + 1. While this is perfectly functional and works, it is more idiomatic in
Python to perform the operation as counter += 1, as shown here:

>>> counter = 1
>>> counter = counter + 1
>>> counter
2
>>>
>>> counter = 5
>>> counter += 5
>>> counter
10

Like addition, subtraction requires nothing special. Let’s dive right into an example:

>>> 100 - 90
10
>>> count = 50
>>> count - 20
30

When multiplying, yet again, there is no difference:

>>> 100 * 50
5000
>>>
>>> print(2 * 25)
50

The nice thing about the multiplication operator (*) is that you can also use it on
strings. You may want to format something and make it nice and pretty:

>>> print('=' * 50)
==================================================

The preceding example is basic but powerful. Not knowing this is possible, you
may be tempted to print one line a time and print a string with the command
print(================), but in reality after learning this and a few other tips
covered later in the chapter, pretty-printing text data becomes much simpler.

If you haven’t performed any math by hand in recent years, division may seem
like a nightmare. As expected, though, it is no different from the previous three
mathematical operations reviewed—well, sort of.

Understanding Python Data Types

183


To perform a division operation, you still begin by entering 10 / 2, or 100 / 50, and
so on, like so:

>>> 100 / 50
2

These examples are probably what you expected to see.

However, you might see a difference in the result, as compared to manual division:

>>> 12 / 10
1

As you know, the number 10 goes into 12 one time. This is called the quotient, so here
the quotient is equal to 1. What is not displayed or returned is the remainder. To see
the remainder in Python, you must use the %, or modulus, operation.

>>> 12 % 10
2

This means to fully calculate the result of a division problem, you use both the / and
% operators.

You can convert (or cast) an integer to a string by using str(10),
and also do the opposite, converting a string to an integer by using
int('10'):

>>> str(10)
'10'
>>> int('10')
10

That was a brief look at how to work with numbers in Python. We’ll now move on to
booleans.

Booleans

Boolean objects, otherwise known as objects that are of type bool in Python, are fairly
straightforward. Let’s first review the basics of general boolean logic by looking at a
truth table (Table 6-2).

Table 6-2. Boolean truth table

A
B
A and B
A or B
Not A

False
False
False
False
True

False
True
False
True
True

True
False
False
True
False

True
True
True
True
False

184
|
Chapter 6: Python


Notice that all values in the table are either True or False. This is because with
boolean logic, all values are reduced to either True or False. This makes booleans
easy to understand.

Since boolean values can be only True or False, all expressions also evaluate to either
True or False. You can see in the table that both values, for A and B, need to be True,
for “A and B” to evaluate to True. And “A or B” evaluates to True when any value
(A or B) is True. You can also see that when you take the NOT of a boolean value, it
calculates the inverse of that value. This is seen clearly as NOT False yields True and
NOT True yields False.

From a Python perspective, nothing is different. We still have only two boolean
values: True and False. To assign one of these values to a variable within Python, you
must enter it just as you see it (with a capitalized first letter, and without quotes):

>>> exists = True
>>>
>>> exists
True
>>>
>>> exists = true
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

NameError: name 'true' is not defined

As you can see, using booleans is quite simple. Based on the real-time feedback of
the Python interpreter, you can see that using a lowercase t doesn’t work when you’re
trying to assign the value of True to a variable.

Here are a few more examples of using boolean expressions while in the Python
interpreter:

>>> True and True
True
>>>
>>> True or False
True
>>>
>>> False or False
False

In the next example, these same conditions are evaluated, assigning boolean values to
variables:

>>> value1 = True
>>> value2 = False
>>>
>>> value1 and value2
False
>>>
>>> value1 or value2
True

Understanding Python Data Types
|
185


Notice that boolean expressions are also not limited to two objects:

>>> value3 = True
>>> value4 = True
>>>
>>> value1 and value2 and value3 and value4
False
>>>
>>> value1 and value3 and value4
True

When extracting information from a network device, using booleans for a quick
check is common. Is the interface a routed port? Is the management interface config‐
ured? Is the device reachable? While a complex operation may be required to answer
each of those questions, the result is stored as True or False.

The opposite of those questions would be, is the interface a switched port or is the
device not reachable? Having variables or objects for each question wouldn’t make
sense, but we could use the not operator, since we know the not operation returns the
inverse of a boolean value.

Let’s take a look at using not in an example:

>>> not False
>>> True
>>>
>>> is_layer3 = True
>>> not is_layer3
False

This example uses a variable called is_layer3. It is set to True, indicating that an
interface is a Layer 3 port. If you take the not of is_layer3, you would then know if it
is a Layer 2 port.

We introduce conditionals (if-else statements) later in the chapter, but based on the
logic needed, you may need to know whether an interface is in fact Layer 3. If so, you
would have something like if is_layer3:, but if you needed to perform an action if
the interface was Layer 2, then you would use if not is_layer3:.

In addition to using the and and or operands, the equal to (==) and does not equal to
(!=) expressions are used to generate a boolean object. With these expressions, you
can do a comparison, or check, to see whether two or more objects are (or not) equal
to one another:

>>> True == True
True
>>> True != False
True
>>> 'network' == 'network'
True
>>> 'network' == 'no_network'
False

Chapter 6: Python


Empty Objects

Python offers a simple and readable way to evaluate whether an object is empty. If the
object is not empty, the evaluation will return True, and if empty, will return False.
In the following example, you can notice how easy it is to read the code if not
devices:. It’s almost literal: if there are no devices, the assessment will match the if
statement:

>>> devices = []
>>> if not devices:
...
print('devices is empty')

...
devices is empty
>>>
>>> hostname = 'something'
>>>
>>> if hostname:
...
print('hostname is not empty')

...
hostname is not empty

However, even though this evaluation usually matches what we understand as empti‐
ness, the actual logic applied is the boolean evaluation of the object, implemented via
the __bool__ dunder method, and could be customized for our own class, as we will
explore in “Understanding Python Classes” on page 230.

After a quick look at working with boolean objects, operands, and expressions, we are
ready to cover working with Python lists.

Lists

You had a brief introduction to lists when we covered the string built-in methods
called join() and split(). This section covers lists in a bit more detail.

Lists are the object type called list, and at their most basic level are an ordered
sequence of objects. The examples from earlier in the chapter when we looked at the
join() method with strings are provided again next to provide a quick refresher on
how to create a list. Those examples were lists of strings, but it’s also possible to have
lists of any other data type as well, which you’ll see shortly.

>>> hostnames = ['r1', 'r2', 'r3', 'r4', 'r5']
>>> commands = ['config t', 'interface Ethernet1/1', 'shutdown']

Here is a list of objects in which each object is a different data type:

>>> new_list = ['router1', False, 5]
>>>
>>> print(new_list)
['router1', False, 5]

Understanding Python Data Types
|
187


Now you understand that lists are an ordered sequence of objects and are enclosed by
brackets. One of the most common tasks when you’re working with lists is to access
an individual element of the list.

Let’s create a new list of interfaces and show how to print a single element of a list:

>>> interfaces = ['Eth1/1', 'Eth1/2', 'Eth1/3', 'Eth1/4']

The list is created, and now three elements of the list are printed one at a time:

>>> print(interfaces[0])
Eth1/1
>>>
>>> print(interfaces[1])
Eth1/2
>>>
>>> print(interfaces[3])
Eth1/4

To access the individual elements within a list, you use the element’s index value
enclosed within brackets. It’s important to see that the index begins at 0 and ends at
the “length of the list minus 1.” This means in our example, to access the first element,
you use interfaces[0] and to access the last element, you use interfaces[3].

You can easily see that the length of the preceding list is 4, but what if you didn’t
know the length of the list?

Luckily, Python provides a built-in function called len() to help with this:

>>> len(interfaces)
4

So, you can access the last element of the list by subtracting 1 from its length:
list_name[len(list_name) - 1]:

>>> interfaces[len(interfaces) - 1]
'Eth1/4'

Another way, more Pythonic, to access the last element in any list is: list_name[-1].
So, with the minus we are indexing the list from the end, instead of the beginning:

>>> interfaces[-1]
'Eth1/4'

Often, the terms function and method are used interchangeably, but
until now we’ve mainly shown methods, not functions. The slight
difference is that a function is called without referencing a parent
object. As you saw, when you use a built-in method of an object,
it is called using the syntax object.method(), and when you use a
function like len(), you call it directly. That said, it is common to
call a method a function.

188

Chapter 6: Python


The same indexing access used for lists also works for strings. If a variable called
router is assigned the value of "DEVICE", then router[0] returns "D".

However, a string is not a list, so you can’t assign a new value to the indexed position.
String is an immutable type; it cannot be modified. Notice that if you assign a
different value, hostname = 'something else', you are not modifying the string;
you are creating a new one. If you try to modify an element of a string, you will
observe an error raised:

>>> hostname[1] = 'A'
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

A useful technique, to produce a subset of a sequence (such as lists or strings), is
slicing. Using a colon (:) before or after the index, you can indicate that you want
to retrieve all the elements before or after the index, respectively. This can become
pretty powerful when you need to parse through different types of objects:

>>> hostname = 'DEVICE_12345'
>>>
>>> hostname[4:]
'CE_12345'
>>>
>>> hostname[:-2]
'DEVICE_123'

Using built-in methods of Python lists

To view the available built-in methods for lists, the dir() function is used just as we
showed previously when working with string objects. You can create any variable that
is a list or use the formal data type name of list and pass it as an argument to dir().
You’ll use the interfaces list for this:

>>> dir(interfaces)
[... omitted dunders ..., 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index',
'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']

Let’s take a look at a few of these built-in methods.

Using the append() method.    The great thing about these method names, as you’ll con‐
tinue to see, is that they are human-readable, and for the most part, intuitive. The
append() method is used to append, or add, an element to an existing list.

This is shown in the next example, but let’s start with creating an empty list. You do
so by assigning empty brackets to an object:

>>> vendors = []

Understanding Python Data Types
|
189


Let’s append vendors to this list:

>>> vendors.append('arista')
>>>
>>> print(vendors)
['arista']
>>>
>>> vendors.append('cisco')
>>>
>>> print(vendors)
['arista', 'cisco']

You can see that using append() adds the element to the last position in the list. In
contrast to many of the methods reviewed for strings, this method is not returning
anything, but modifying the original variable, or object.

Using the insert() method.    Rather than just append an element to a list, you may need
to insert an element at a specific location. This is done with the insert() method.

To use insert(), you need to pass it two arguments. The first argument is the
position, or index, where the new element gets stored, and the second argument is the
object getting inserted into the list:

>>> commands = ['interface Eth1/1', 'ip address 192.0.2.1/32']

As a reminder, the commands in these examples are generic and do
not map back to a specific vendor or platform.

Let’s now assume you need to add two more commands to the previous commands list.
The command that needs to be added as the first element is config t, and the one
that needs to be added just before the IP address is no switchport:

>>> commands = ['interface Eth1/1', 'ip address 192.0.2.1/32']
>>>
>>> commands.insert(0, 'config t')
>>>
>>> print(commands)
['config t', 'interface Eth1/1', 'ip address 192.0.2.1/32']
>>>
>>> commands.insert(2, 'no switchport')
>>>
>>> print(commands)
['config t', 'interface Eth1/1', 'no switchport', 'ip address 192.0.2.1/32']

190
|
Chapter 6: Python


Using indexes bigger than the actual length of the list will not raise
an error. It will simply insert the objects at the end of the list:

>>> commands.insert(9999, "shutdown")
>>> commands
['config t', 'interface Eth1/1', 'no switchport',
'ip address 192.0.2.1/32', 'shutdown']

Using the count() method.    If you are doing an inventory of types of devices throughout
the network, you may build a list that has more than one of the same object within a
list. To expand on the earlier example, you may have a list that looks like this:

>>> vendors = ['cisco', 'cisco', 'juniper', 'arista', 'cisco', 'hp', 'cumulus',
'arista', 'cisco']

You can count how many instances of a given object are found by using the count()
method. In our example, this can help determine how many Cisco or Arista devices
are in the environment:

>>> vendors.count('cisco')
4
>>>
>>> vendors.count('arista')
2

Note that count() returns an int, or integer, and does not modify the existing
object—unlike insert(), append(), and a few others reviewed in the upcoming
examples.

Using the pop() and index() methods.    Most of the methods thus far have either modified
the original object or returned something. The pop() method does both:

>>> hostnames = ['r1', 'r2', 'r3', 'r4', 'r5']

The preceding example has a list of hostnames. Let’s pop (remove) r5 because that
device was just decommissioned from the network:

>>> hostnames.pop()
'r5'
>>>
>>> print(hostnames)
['r1', 'r2', 'r3', 'r4']

As you can see, the element being popped is returned, and the original list is modified
as well. You should also notice that no element or index value was passed in, so you
can see by default, pop() pops the last element in the list.

What if you need to pop r2? It turns out that to pop an element that is not the last
one, you need to pass in an index value of the element that you wish to pop. But how
do you find the index value of a given element? This is where the index() method
comes into play.

Understanding Python Data Types
|
191


To find the index value of a certain element, use index():

>>> hostnames.index('r2')
1

Here you see that the index of the value r2 is 1.

So, to pop r2, you would perform the following:

>>> hostnames.pop(1)
'r2'
>>>
>>> print(hostnames)
['r1', 'r3', 'r4']

You could also do this in a single step:

>>> hostnames.pop(hostnames.index('r2'))

Using the sort() method.    The last built-in method to take a look at for lists is sort().
As you may have guessed, sort() is used to sort a list.

In the next example, you have a list of IP addresses in nonsequential order, and you
use sort() to update the original object. Notice that nothing is returned:

>>> available_ips = ['10.1.1.1', '10.1.1.9', '10.1.1.8', '10.1.1.7', '10.1.1.4']
>>>
>>> available_ips.sort()
>>>
>>> available_ips
['10.1.1.1', '10.1.1.4', '10.1.1.7', '10.1.1.8', '10.1.1.9']

The sort from the previous example sorts IP addresses as strings
instead of as IP addresses. So, if in available_ips you had
2.2.2.2, this “smaller” IP address will be sorted to be the last,
because, as characters, 10 < 2.

A useful practice when working with methods is to check the available customization
options. Usually, a method behavior has already implemented some tuning options to
cover the common use cases. The help() method will show you all the detail:

>>> help(list.sort)
Help on method_descriptor:

sort(self, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)

Sort the list in ascending order and return None.
...

The reverse flag can be set to sort in descending order.

(END)

192
|
Chapter 6: Python


The sort() method supports a named boolean argument, reverse, that can sort the
list in descending order:

>>> available_ips.sort(reverse=True)
>>>
>>> available_ips
['10.1.1.9', '10.1.1.8', '10.1.1.7', '10.1.1.4', '10.1.1.1']

In nearly all our list examples, the elements of the list are the same type of object;
that is, they are all strings: commands, IP addresses, vendors, or hostnames. However,
Python allows you to create lists that store different types of objects.

A prime example of storing different objects arises when storing information about
a particular device. Maybe you want to store the hostname, vendor, and OS. A list to
store these device attributes would look something like this:

>>> device = ['router1', 'juniper', '12.2']

Since elements of a list are indexed by an integer, you need to keep track of which
index is mapped to which particular attribute. While it may not seem hard for this
example, what if 10, 20, or 100 attributes need to be accessed? Even if mappings were
available, it could get extremely difficult since lists are ordered. Replacing or updating
any element in a list would need to be done carefully.

Wouldn’t it be nice if you could reference the individual elements of a list by name
and not worry so much about the order of elements? So, rather than access the
hostname by using device[0], you could access it like device['hostname']. As luck
would have it, this is exactly where Python dictionaries come into action, and they are
the next data type we cover in this chapter.

Python Dictionaries

We’ve now reviewed some of the most common data types, including strings, inte‐
gers, booleans, and lists, which exist across all programming languages. In this
section, we introduce the dictionary, which is a Python-specific data type. In other
languages, they are known as associative arrays, maps, or hash maps.

Dictionaries are ordered lists by insertion, and their values are accessed by names,
otherwise known as keys, instead of by index (integer). Dictionaries are simply a
collection of key-value pairs called items.

In earlier versions of Python, dictionaries were an unordered data
structure. You were not able to warrant the order of the items.
However, as of Python 3.7, dictionaries are guaranteed to preserve
the order in which key-value pairs are inserted.

Understanding Python Data Types

193


We finished the previous section on lists with this example:

>>> device = ['router1', 'juniper', '12.2']

If you build on this example and convert the list device to a dictionary, it would look
like this:

>>> device = {'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1'}

The notation for a dictionary is a curly brace ({), then key, colon, and value, for each
key-value pair, separated by a comma (,), and then it closes with another curly brace
(}).

Once the dict object is created, you access the desired value by using dict[key]:

>>> print(device['hostname'])
router1
>>>
>>> print(device['os'])
12.1
>>>
>>> print(device['vendor'])
juniper

You can create the same dictionary from the previous example in a few ways. Two are
shown here:

>>> device = {}
>>> device['hostname'] = 'router1'
>>> device['vendor'] = 'juniper'
>>> device['os'] = '12.1'
>>>
>>> print(device)
{'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1'}

>>> device = dict(hostname='router1', vendor='juniper', os='12.1')
>>>
>>> print(device)
{'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1'}

Using built-in methods of Python dictionaries

Python dictionaries have a few built-in methods worth covering, so as usual, we’ll
dive right into them. Just as with the other data types, we first present all available
methods minus those that start and end with underscores:

>>> dir(dict)
['clear', 'copy', 'fromkeys', 'get', 'items', 'keys', 'pop', 'popitem',
'setdefault', 'update', 'values']

Using the get() method.    You saw earlier how to access a key-value pair of a dictionary
by using the notation of dict[key]. That is a popular approach, but with one caveat.
If the key does not exist, Python raises a KeyError (similarly, a list would raise an
IndexError when accessing a nonexistent position):

194
|
Chapter 6: Python


>>> device
{'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1'}
>>>
>>> print(device['model'])
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

KeyError: 'model'

Using the get() method provides another approach that is arguably safer, unless you
want to raise an exception. We explore more about exceptions in “Embracing Failure
with try/except” on page 234.

Let’s first look at an example using get() when the key exists:

>>> device.get('hostname')
'router1'

And now an example of when a key doesn’t exist:

>>> device.get('model')
>>>

As you can see, absolutely nothing is returned when the key isn’t in the dictionary,
but it gets better than that. The get() method also allows the user to define a value to
return when the key does not exist! Let’s take a look:

>>> device.get('model', False)
False
>>>
>>> device.get('model', 'DOES NOT EXIST')
'DOES NOT EXIST'
>>>
>>> device.get('hostname', 'DOES NOT EXIST')
'router1'

Pretty simple, right? You can see that the value to the right of the key is returned only
if the key does not exist within the dictionary.

Using the keys() and values() methods.    Dictionaries are a list of key-value pairs. Using
the built-in methods keys() and values(), you can access each object individually.

In Python 3, these methods do not return a simple list but dictionary view objects that
can be iterated to yield the data, as you will see in “Using Loops in Python” on page
203. Notice that the order of the items is preserved:

>>> device.keys()
dict_keys(['hostname', 'vendor', 'os'])
>>>
>>> device.values()
dict_values(['router1', 'juniper', '12.1'])

Understanding Python Data Types

195


However, these view objects can’t be accessed directly:

>>> device.keys()[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'dict_keys' object is not subscriptable

To access a specific object, you need to first convert the data to a list with list():

>>> list(device.keys())[0]
'hostname'

Using the pop() method.    We introduced the built-in method pop() earlier in the chap‐
ter when we were reviewing lists. It just so happens dictionaries also have a pop()
method, and it’s used similarly. Instead of passing the method an index value as you
did with lists, you pass it a key:

>>> device
{'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1'}
>>>
>>> device.pop('vendor')
'juniper'
>>>
>>> device
{'hostname': 'router1', 'os': '12.1'}

You can see that pop() modifies the original object and returns the value being
popped.

Using the update() method.    There may come a time when you are extracting device
information such as hostname, vendor, and OS from a network device and storing
it in a Python dictionary. And down the road you need to add to or update it with
another dictionary that has other attributes about a device.

The following shows two dictionaries:

>>> device = {'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1'}
>>>
>>> oper = dict(cpu='5%', memory='10%')
>>>
>>> oper
{'cpu': '5%', 'memory': '10%'}

You can use the update() method to update one of the dictionaries, basically adding
one dictionary to the other. Let’s add oper to device:

>>> device.update(oper)
>>>
>>> print(device)
{'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1', 'cpu': '5%',
'memory': '10%'}

196
|
Chapter 6: Python


If a match occurs with a dictionary key, the update() method will update the old
value with the new value from the new dictionary. In the next example, the vendor
key from device is changed from the original juniper to arista because the data
from new_vendor is updated on the reference dictionary:

>>> new_vendor = {'vendor': 'arista'}
>>>
>>> device.update(new_vendor)
>>>
>>> print(device)
{'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'arista', 'os': '12.1', 'cpu': '5%',
'memory': '10%'}

Notice that nothing is returned with update(). Only the object being updated, or
device in this case, is modified.

Using the items() method.    When working with dictionaries, you’ll see items() used a
lot, so it is extremely important to understand—not to discount the other methods, of
course!

You saw how to access individual values via get() and how to get a list of all the keys
and values via the keys() and values() methods, respectively. What about accessing
a particular key-value pair of a given item at the same time, or iterating over all
items? If you need to iterate (or loop) through a dictionary and simultaneously access
keys and values, items() is a great tool for your tool belt.

We formally introduce loops later in this chapter, but because
items() is commonly used with a for loop, we are showing an
example with a for loop here. The important takeaway is that when
using the for loop with items(), you can access a key and value of
a given item at the same time.

The most basic example is looping through a dictionary with a for loop and printing
the key and value for each item. Again, loops are covered later in the chapter, but this
is meant just to give a basic introduction to items():

>>> for key, value in device.items():
...
print(f'{key}: {value}')

...
hostname: router1
vendor: arista
os: 12.1
cpu: 5%
memory: 10%

In the for loop, key and value are user-defined and could have been anything, as you
can see in this example:

>>> for my_attribute, my_value, in device.items():
...
print(f'{my_attribute}: {my_value}')

...
hostname: router1
vendor: arista
os: 12.1
cpu: 5%
memory: 10%

Now that we’ve covered the major data types in Python, you should have a good
understanding of how to work with strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionar‐
ies. Next we introduce two more data types—sets and tuples—that are a bit more
advanced than the previous data types covered.

Sets and Tuples

The next two data types don’t necessarily need to be covered in an introduction to
Python, but as we said at the beginning of the chapter, we want to include a quick
summary of them for completeness. These data types are set and tuple.

If you understand lists, you’ll understand sets. Sets are a list of elements, but there can
be only one of a given element in a set, and additionally, elements cannot be indexed
(or accessed by an index value, like a list).

You can see that a set looks like a list, but is surrounded by set():

>>> vendors = set(['arista', 'cisco', 'arista', 'cisco', 'juniper', 'cisco'])

This set is being created with multiple elements that are the same. We used a similar
example when using the count() method with lists to count the number of devices
from a given vendor. But what if you want to know only how many, and which,
vendors exist in an environment? You can use a set:

>>> vendors = set(['arista', 'cisco', 'arista', 'cisco', 'juniper', 'cisco'])
>>>
>>> vendors
set(['cisco', 'juniper', 'arista'])
>>>
>>> len(vendors)
3

Notice that vendors contains only three elements.

The next example shows what happens when you try to access an element within a
set. You must iterate through the elements, using a for loop as an example:

>>> vendors[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable

We leave as an exercise for you to explore the built-in methods for sets.

Chapter 6: Python


The tuple is an interesting data type and also best understood when compared to a
list. It is like a list but cannot be modified. You saw that lists are mutable, meaning
that you can update, extend, and modify them. Tuples, on the other hand, are
immutable, and you can’t modify them after they’re created. Also, as with lists, it’s
possible to access individual elements of tuples:

>>> description = ('ROUTER1', 'PORTLAND')
>>>
>>> description
('ROUTER1', 'PORTLAND')
>>>
>>> print(description[0])
ROUTER1

After the variable object description is created, there is no way to modify it. You
cannot modify any of the elements or add new elements. This could help if you need
to create an object and want to ensure that no other function or user can modify
it. The next example shows that you cannot modify a tuple and that a tuple has no
methods such as update() or append():

>>> description[1] = 'trying to modify one'
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>>
>>> dir(tuple)
[... omitted dunders ..., 'count', 'index']

To help compare and contrast lists, tuples, and sets, we have put this high-level
summary together:

Lists
Are mutable, can be modified, contain individual elements they can be accessed
directly, and can have duplicate values

Sets
Are mutable, can be modified, contain individual elements that cannot be
accessed directly, and cannot have duplicate values

Tuples
Are immutable, cannot be updated or modified after they’re created, contain
individual elements that can be accessed directly, and can have duplicate values

You have learned about various Python types, each with its own behavior and meth‐
ods. So, in your programs you might like to validate the variable’s type before using
it. The isinstance() built-in function can identify a type, not only for built-in types
but also custom-class types:

>>> hostname = ''
>>> devices = []

Understanding Python Data Types

199


>>> if isinstance(devices, list):
...
print('devices is a list')

...
devices is a list
>>>
>>> if isinstance(hostname, str):
...
print('hostname is a string')

...
hostname is a string

This concludes the section on data types. We’ll now shift gears a bit and jump into
using conditionals (if then logic) in Python.

Adding Conditional Logic to Your Code

By now you should have a solid understanding of working with various types
of objects. The beauty of programming comes into play when you start to use those
objects by applying logic within your code, such as executing a task or creating an
object when a particular condition is true (or not true!).

Conditionals are a key part of applying logic within your code, and understanding
conditionals starts with understanding the if statement. Let’s start with a basic
example that checks the value of a string:

>>> hostname = 'NYC'
>>>
>>> if hostname == 'NYC':
...
print('The hostname is NYC')

...
The hostname is NYC

Even if you did not understand Python before starting this chapter, odds are you
know what is being done in this example. This is part of the value of working in
Python—it tries to be as human-readable as possible.

When you’re working with an if statement, note two parts of the syntax. First, all if
statements end with a colon (:). Second, the code that gets executed if your condition
is true is part of an indented block—this indentation should be four spaces, but the
number of spaces technically does not matter. All that technically matters is that you
are consistent.

Generally speaking, it is good practice to use a four-space indent
when writing Python code. This is widely accepted by the Python
community as the norm for writing idiomatic Python code. This
makes code sharing and collaboration much easier.

The following shows a full indented code block:

200
|
Chapter 6: Python


>>> if hostname == 'NYC':
...
print('This hostname is NYC')

...
print(len(hostname))

...
print('The End.')

...
This hostname is NYC
3
The End.

Now that you understand how to construct a basic if statement, let’s add to it.

What if you need to do a check to see if the hostname is NJ in addition to NYC? To
accomplish this, you use the else if statement, or elif:

>>> hostname = 'NJ'
>>>
>>> if hostname == 'NYC':
...
print('This hostname is NYC')

... elif hostname == 'NJ':
...
print('This hostname is NJ')

...
This hostname is NJ

Similar to the if statement, the elif statement needs to end with a colon, and the
associated code block to be executed must be indented. The elif statement also must
be aligned to the if statement.

What if NYC and NJ are the only valid hostnames, but now you need to execute a block
of code if another hostname is being used? This is where you use the else statement:

>>> hostname = 'DEN_CO'
>>>
>>> if hostname == 'NYC':
...
print('This hostname is NYC')

... elif hostname == 'NJ':
...
print('This hostname is NJ')

... else:
...
print('UNKNOWN HOSTNAME')

...
UNKNOWN HOSTNAME

Using else isn’t any different from using if and elif. It needs a colon (:) and an
indented code block underneath it to execute.

When Python executes conditional statements, the conditional block is exited as soon
as a match occurs. For example, if hostname is equal to NYC, there would be a match
on the first line of the conditional block, the print statement print('This hostname
is NYC') would be executed, and then the block would be exited (no other elif or
else would be executed).

The following is an example of an error produced because of incorrect indentation.
The example has extra spaces in front of elif that should not be there:

>>> if hostname == 'NYC':
...
print('This hostname is NYC')

...
elif hostname == 'NJ':

File "<stdin>", line 3

elif hostname == 'NJ':

^

IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level

And the following shows an error produced by a missing colon:

>>> if hostname == 'NYC'

File "<stdin>", line 1

if hostname == 'NYC'

^

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

The point is, even if you have a typo in your code when you’re just getting started,
don’t worry; you’ll see pretty intuitive error messages.

You will continue to see conditionals in upcoming examples, including the next one,
which introduces the concept of containment.

Understanding Containment

When we say containment, we are referring to the ability to check whether an object
contains a specific element or object. Specifically, let’s look at the usage of in, building
on what you just learned with conditionals. Although this section covers only in,
don’t underestimate this powerful containment feature of Python.

If you use the vendors variable that has been used in previous examples, how would
you check to see if a particular vendor exists? One option is to loop through the entire
list and compare the vendor you’re looking for with each object. That’s definitely
possible, but why not just use in?

Using containment is not only readable, but also simplifies the process for checking
whether an object has what you are looking for:

>>> vendors = ['arista', 'juniper', 'cumulus', 'cisco']
>>>
>>> 'arista' in vendors
True

This syntax is straightforward, and a bool is returned. It’s worth mentioning that
this syntax is another one of those expressions that is considered writing idiomatic
Python code.

This can now be taken a step further and added into a conditional statement:

>>> if 'arista' in vendors:
...
print('Arista is deployed.')

...
'Arista is deployed.'

202

Chapter 6: Python


Just as in previous examples, where you checked whether an element was in a list, in
this next example, check to see if part of a string is in another string. You use a basic
boolean expression and then use the expression in a conditional statement:

>>> version = "CSR1000V (X86_64_LINUX_IOSD-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 16.3.1"
>>>
>>> "16.3.1" in version
True
>>>
>>> if "16.3.1" in version:
...
print("Version is 16.3.1!!")

...
Version is 16.3.1!!

The in operator is implemented by the __contains__ dunder
method. So, any object that implements this method can be used
with the in operator.

As we previously stated, containment when combined with conditionals is a simple
yet powerful way to check whether an object or value exists within another object.
In fact, when you’re just starting out, it is quite common to build really long and
complex conditional statements, but what you really need is a more efficient way to
evaluate the elements of a given object.

One such way is to use loops while working with objects such as lists and dictionaries.
Using loops simplifies the process of working with these types of objects. This will
become much clearer soon, as our next section formally introduces loops.

Using Loops in Python

We’ve finally made it to loops. As objects continue to grow, especially those that are
much larger than our examples thus far, loops are absolutely required. Start to think
about lists of devices, IP addresses, VLANs, and interfaces. We’ll need efficient ways
to search data or perform the same operation on each element in a set of data (as
examples). This is where loops begin to show their value.

In this section, we cover two main types of loops: the for loop and while loop. From
the perspective of a network engineer who is looking at automating network devices
and general infrastructure, you can get away with almost always using a for loop. Of
course, it depends on exactly what you are doing, but generally speaking, for loops in
Python are pretty awesome, so we’ll save them for last.

The while Loop

The general premise behind a while loop is that a set of code is executed while a
certain condition is true. In the example that follows, the variable counter is set to
1 and then for as long as, or while, it is less than 5, the variable is printed, and then
increased by 1.

The syntax required is similar to what we used when creating if-elif-else state‐
ments. The while statement is completed with a colon (:), and the code to be
executed is indented four spaces:

>>> counter = 1
>>>
>>> while counter < 5:
...
print(counter)

...
counter += 1

...
1

This introduction is all we are going to cover on the while loop, as we’ll be using the
for loop in the majority of examples going forward.

The for Loop

The for loop in Python is awesome because when you use it, you are usually looping,
or iterating, over a set of objects, like those found in a list, string, or dictionary. In
other programming languages, for loops require an index and increment value to
always be specified, which is not the case in Python.

Let’s start by reviewing a for-in, or for-each loop, which is the most common type of
for loop in Python. As in the previous sections, we start by reviewing a few basic
examples.

The first prints each object within a list. You can see in the following example that the
syntax is simple, and again, much like what you learned when using conditionals and
the while loop. The first statement, or the beginning of the for loop, needs to end
with a colon (:), and the code to be executed must be indented:

>>> vendors = ['arista', 'juniper', 'cisco']
>>>
>>> for vendor in vendors:
...
print(f'VENDOR: {vendor}')

...
VENDOR:
arista
VENDOR:
juniper
VENDOR:
cisco

204
|
Chapter 6: Python


As mentioned earlier, this type of for loop is often called a for-in or for-each loop
because you are iterating over each element in a given object.

In the example, the name of the object vendor is totally arbitrary and up to the user
to define, and for each iteration, vendor is equal to that specific element. For example,
in this example vendor equals arista during the first iteration, juniper in the second
iteration, and so on.

To show that vendor can be named anything, let’s rename it network_vendor:

>>> for network_vendor in vendors:
...
print(f'VENDOR: {network_vendor}')

...
VENDOR:
arista
VENDOR:
juniper
VENDOR:
cisco

Let’s now combine a few of the things you’ve learned so far with containment,
conditionals, and loops.

In the next example, you have a new list of vendors. One of them is a great company,
but just not cut out to be a network vendor! Then, you define approved_vendors,
which is basically the approved vendors for a given customer. This example loops
through the vendors to ensure that they are all approved, and if not, prints a state‐
ment saying so to the terminal:

>>> vendors = ['arista', 'juniper', 'cisco', 'oreilly']
>>>
>>> approved_vendors = ['arista', 'juniper', 'cisco']
>>>
>>> for vendor in vendors:
...
if vendor not in approved_vendors:

...
print(f'NETWORK VENDOR NOT APPROVED: {vendor}')

...
NETWORK VENDOR NOT APPROVED:
oreilly

You can see that not can be used in conjunction with in, making the code powerful
and easy to read.

Example 6-1 is a more challenging example: you loop through a dictionary, while
extracting data from another dictionary, and even get to use some built-in methods
you learned earlier in this chapter.

Full versions of the code examples in this chapter can be found in
the book’s GitHub repo at https://github.com/oreilly-npa-book/exam
ples/tree/v2/ch06-python.

Using Loops in Python

Example 6-1. Using a for loop with items()

>>> COMMANDS = {
...
'description': 'description {}',

...
'speed': 'speed {}',

...
'duplex': 'duplex {}',

... }
>>> CONFIG_PARAMS = {
...
'description': 'auto description by Python',

...
'speed': '10000',

...
'duplex': 'auto'

... }
>>> commands_list = []
>>>
>>> for feature, value in CONFIG_PARAMS.items():
...
command = COMMANDS.get(feature).format(value)

...
commands_list.append(command)

...
>>> commands_list.insert(0, 'interface Eth1/1')
>>>
>>> print(commands_list)
['interface Eth1/1', 'description auto description by Python',
'speed 10000', 'duplex auto']

Using uppercase variables (e.g., COMMANDS or CONFIG_PARAMS) is a
Python convention to refer to variables containing constant values,
which do not change during execution.

In this example, you start building a dictionary that stores CLI commands to config‐
ure certain features on a network device into the COMMANDS variable.

You have a dictionary of three items (key-value pairs). Each item’s key is a network
feature to configure, and each item’s value is the start of a command string that’ll con‐
figure that respective feature. These features include speed, duplex, and description.
Each value of the dictionary is followed by curly braces ({}) because you’ll be using
the format() method of strings to insert variables.

After the COMMANDS dictionary is created, you create a second dictionary called CON
FIG_PARAMS that will be used to dictate which commands will be executed and which
value will be used for each command string defined in COMMANDS.

Then you use a for loop to iterate through CONFIG_PARAMS() using the items built-in
method for dictionaries. As you iterate through, you’ll use the key from CONFIG_
PARAMS to get the proper value, or command string, from COMMANDS. This is possible
because they were prebuilt using the same key structure. The command string is
returned with curly braces, but as soon as it’s returned, you use the format() method
to insert the proper value, which happens to be the value in CONFIG_PARAMS.

206

Chapter 6: Python


Now we’ll walk through this in even more detail. Please take your time and even test
this out yourself while on the Python interactive interpreter.

In the first line, commands_list is creating an empty list []. This is required in order
to append() to this list later.

You then use the items() built-in method as you loop through CONFIG_PARAMS. This
was covered briefly earlier in the chapter, but items() is giving you, the network
developer, access to both the key and value of a given key-value pair at the same time.
This example iterates more than three key-value pairs: description/auto descrip
tion by Python, speed/10000, and duplex/auto.

During each iteration—that is, for each key-value pair that is being referred to as the
variables feature and value—a command is being pulled from the COMMANDS dictio‐
nary. As you may recall, the get() method is used to get the value of a key-value pair
when you specify the key. In the example, this key is the feature object. The value
being returned is description {} for description, speed {} for speed, and duplex
{} for duplex. As you can see, all of these objects being returned are strings, so then
you are able to use the format() method to insert the value from CONFIG_PARAMS
because you also saw earlier that multiple methods can be used together on the same
line. Once the value is inserted, the command is appended to commands_list.

Finally, after the commands are built, you insert interface Eth1/1 as the first item of
the list. This could have also been done first, with commands_list = ['interface
Eth1/1']. If you understand this example, you’re at a really good point already with
getting a grasp on Python!

You’ve now seen some of the most common types of for loops that allow you to
iterate over lists and dictionaries. We’ll now take a look at another way to construct
and use a for loop.

Using the enumerate() function

Occasionally, you may need to keep track of an index value as you loop through an
object. We show this fairly briefly, since most of these examples are like the previous
examples already covered.

The enumerate() function is used to enumerate the list and give an index value, and
is often handy to determine the exact position of a given element.

The next example shows how to use enumerate() within a for loop. You’ll notice that
the beginning part of the for loop looks like the dictionary examples, only unlike
items(), which returns a key and value, enumerate() returns an index, starting at 0,
and the object from the list that you are enumerating.

The example prints both the index and value to help you understand what it is doing:

Using Loops in Python
|
207


>>> vendors = ['arista', 'juniper', 'cisco']
>>>
>>> for index, each in enumerate(vendors):
...
print(f'{index} {each}')

...
0 arista
1 juniper
2 cisco

Maybe you don’t need to print all indices and values. Maybe you need only the index
for a given vendor. This is shown in this example:

>>> for index, each in enumerate(vendors):
...
if each == 'arista':

...
print(f'arista index is: {index}')

...
arista index is:
0

Flow control within loops

Loops can become a trap. In the enumerate example, you started and completed a full
iteration over the objects in vendors, even though you were interested in only the
ones matching arista. In that case, this was not a big issue because the list had three
items. But, what if vendors had thousands of elements? Should you continue iterating
over the list when you have already found the item you were looking for?

Luckily, Python has a break statement to stop a loop iteration at any point—for
example, when the purpose of the loop is fulfilled. In the following variation, you add
a print() for each iteration and a break to stop the loop once you find arista, so
you can see how the loop is stopped when a condition is met:

>>> vendors = ['arista', 'juniper', 'cisco']
>>>
>>> for index, each in enumerate(vendors):
...
print(index)

...
if each == 'arista':

...
print(f'arista index is: {index}')

...
break

...
0
arista index is: 0

Another useful statement is continue, to jump to the next iteration of the loop
and skip any pending logic for the present iteration. In the next example, you use
continue to achieve the same goal, printing the arista index:

>>> for index, each in enumerate(vendors):
...
print(index)

...
if each != 'arista':

...
continue

...
print(f'arista index is: {index}')

...
0

208
|
Chapter 6: Python


arista index is: 0
1
2

Obviously, in this case you are not breaking the loop (you are not using break), and
you print all the indexes but not the strings. Using continue makes the code easy
to read: adding a condition at the beginning of the iteration helps you understand
whether it makes sense to continue with the iteration or to move to the next one.

We’ve covered quite a bit of Python so far, from data types to conditionals to loops.
However, we still haven’t discussed how to efficiently reuse code via functions. This is
what we cover next.

Using Python Functions

Because you are reading this book, you probably at some point have heard of
functions, but if not, don’t worry—we have you covered! Functions are all about
eliminating redundant and duplicate code and easily allowing for the reuse of code.

On a daily basis, network engineers are configuring VLANs over and over again.
And they are likely proud of how fast they can enter the same CLI commands into
a network device or switch over and over. Writing a script with functions eliminates
writing the same code over and over.

Let’s assume you need to create a few VLANs across a set of switches. Based on a
device from Cisco or Arista, the commands required may look something this:

vlan 10

name USERS
vlan 20

name VOICE
vlan 30

name WLAN

Imagine you need to configure 10, 20, or 50 devices with the same VLANs! You
likely would type in those six commands for as many devices as you have in your
environment.

This is actually a perfect opportunity to create a function and write a small script.
Since we haven’t covered scripts yet, we’ll still be working in the Python shell.

For our first example, you’ll start with a basic print() function and then come right
back to the VLAN example:

>>> def print_vendor(net_vendor):
...
print(net_vendor)

...
>>>
>>> vendors = ['arista', 'juniper', 'cisco']
>>>
>>> for vendor in vendors:

Using Python Functions
|
209


...
print_vendor(vendor)

...
arista
juniper
cisco

Here, print_vendor() is a function that is created and defined using def. If you
want to pass variables (parameters) into your function, you enclose them within
parentheses next to the function name. This example is receiving one parameter
and is referenced as net_vendor while in the function called print_vendor(). Like
conditionals and loops, function declarations also end with a colon (:). Within
the function, an indented code block has a single statement—it simply prints the
parameter being received.

Once the function is created, it is ready to be immediately used, even while in the
Python interpreter.

For this first example, we looped through vendors. During each iteration of the loop,
we passed the object, which is a string of the vendor’s name, to print_vendor().

Notice that the variables have different names based on where they are being used,
meaning that you are passing vendor, but it’s received and referenced as net_vendor
from within the function. There is no requirement to have the variables use the same
name within the function, although it’ll work just fine if you choose to do it that way.

Since you now understand how to create a basic function, let’s return to the VLAN
example and create two functions to help automate VLAN provisioning; see Exam‐
ples 6-2 and 6-3.

Example 6-2. get_commands() function

>>> def get_commands(vlan, name):
...
commands = []

...
commands.append(f'vlan {vlan}')

...
commands.append(f'name {name}')

...
return commands

...

The get_commands() function accepts two parameters: vlan indicates the VLAN
ID, and name indicates the name.

Returns a list of commands crafted from the input arguments.

210
|
Chapter 6: Python


Example 6-3. push_commands() function

>>> def push_commands(device, commands):
...
print(f'Connecting to device: {device}')

...
for cmd in commands:

...
print(f'Sending command: {cmd}')

...

This function also accepts two parameters: device, which is the device to send
the commands to, and commands, which is the list of commands to send.

In reality, the actual configuration push isn’t happening in this function, but
rather it is printing commands to the terminal to simulate the command
execution.

To use these functions, you need two things: a list of devices to configure and the list
of VLANs to send. The list of devices to be configured is as follows:

>>> devices = ['switch1', 'switch2', 'switch3']

To create a single object to represent the VLANs, we have created a list of dictionar‐
ies. Each dictionary has two key-value pairs, one pair for the VLAN ID and one for
the VLAN name:

>>> vlans = [{'id': '10', 'name': 'USERS'}, {'id': '20', 'name': 'VOICE'},
{'id': '30', 'name': 'WLAN'}]

As you may recall, Python provides more than one way to create a dictionary. Any of
those options could have been used here.

In Example 6-4, we use these functions. The following code loops through the vlans
list. Remember that each element in vlans is a dictionary. For each element, or
dictionary, the id and name are obtained by way of the get() method. There are
two print statements, and then the first function, get_commands(), is called—id and
name are parameters that get sent to the function, and then a list of commands is
returned and assigned to commands.

Example 6-4. Using defined functions

>>> for vlan in vlans:
...
vid = vlan.get('id')

...
name = vlan.get('name')

...
print(f'CONFIGURING VLAN: {vid}')

...
commands = get_commands(vid, name)

...
for device in devices:

...
push_commands(device, commands)

...
print()

...

Using Python Functions

211


Combining two for loops, for vlans and devices, will provide full coverage of
VLAN configuration per device.

Using the get_commands() function from before, we can obtain all the necessary
commands per VLAN.

Once we have the commands for a given VLAN, they are executed on each
device by looping through devices.

And this is the output generated:

CONFIGURING VLAN: 10
Connecting to device: switch1
Sending command: vlan 10
Sending command: name USERS

Connecting to device: switch2
Sending command: vlan 10
Sending command: name USERS

Connecting to device: switch3
Sending command: vlan 10
Sending command: name USERS

Sending command: name WLAN

Remember, not all functions require parameters, and not all
functions return a value.

In this output, you may notice that we pivoted on the VLANs instead of the devices,
which resulted in tearing up and down several connections to the devices (one per
VLAN). Swapping the for loops and pivoting on the devices could have reduced the
number of necessary device connections by consolidating all the VLAN changes.

You should now have a basic understanding of creating and using functions, under‐
standing how they are called and defined with and without parameters, and how it’s
possible to call functions from within loops. Next, we cover how to read and write
data from files in Python.

Working with Files

This section shows you how to read and write data from files. Our focus is on
presenting the basics so you’ll then be able to easily pick up other sources to continue
learning about working with files.

Reading from a File

For our example, a configuration snippet is located in the same directory from where
you entered the Python interpreter. The file, named vlans.cfg, looks like this:

vlan 10
  name USERS
vlan 20
  name VOICE
vlan 30
  name WLAN
vlan 40
  name APP
vlan 50
  name WEB
vlan 60
  name DB

With just two lines in Python, you can open and read the file:

>>> vlans_file = open('vlans.cfg', 'r')
>>>
>>> vlans_file.read()
'vlan 10\n  name USERS\nvlan 20\n  name VOICE\nvlan 30\n
name WLAN\nvlan 40\n
name APP\nvlan 50\n
name WEB\nvlan 60\n

name DB'

>>>
>>> vlans_file.close()

You read the full file as a complete str object by using the read() method for file
objects.

The next example reads the file and stores each line as an element in a list by using
the readlines() method for file objects:

>>> vlans_file = open('vlans.cfg', 'r')
>>>
>>> vlans_file.readlines()
['vlan 10\n', '  name USERS\n', 'vlan 20\n', '  name VOICE\n', 'vlan 30\n',
'  name WLAN\n', 'vlan 40\n', '  name APP\n', 'vlan 50\n', '  name WEB\n',
'vlan 60\n', '  name DB']
>>>
>>> vlans_file.close()

Let’s reopen the file, save the contents as a string, but then manipulate it in order
to store the VLANs as a dictionary (similar to the way you used the vlans object in
Example 6-4):

>>> vlans_file = open('vlans.cfg', 'r')
>>>
>>> vlans_text = vlans_file.read()
>>>
>>> vlans_list = vlans_text.splitlines()
>>>
>>> vlans_list
['vlan 10', '  name USERS', 'vlan 20', '  name VOICE', 'vlan 30',
'  name WLAN', 'vlan 40', '  name APP', 'vlan 50', '  name WEB',
'vlan 60', '  name DB']

The file is read, and the contents are stored as a string in vlans_text. A built-in
method for strings called splitlines() is used to create a list; each element in the list
is each line within the file. This new list is called vlans_list and has a length equal to
the number of commands that were in the file.

Next, in Example 6-5, we normalize the raw text content into a list of dictionaries.

Example 6-5. Normalizing raw text into a list of dictionaries

>>> vlans = []
>>> for item in vlans_list:
...
if 'vlan' in item:

...
temp = {}

...
id = item.strip().strip('vlan').strip()

...
temp['id'] = id

...
elif 'name' in item:

...
name = item.strip().strip('name').strip()

...
temp['name'] = name

...
vlans.append(temp)

...
>>>
>>> vlans
[{'id': '10', 'name': 'USERS'}, {'id': '20', 'name': 'VOICE'},

214
|
Chapter 6: Python


{'id': '30', 'name': 'WLAN'}, {'id': '40', 'name': 'APP'},
{'id': '50', 'name': 'WEB'}, {'id': '60', 'name': 'DB'}]
>>>

Once the list is created, it is iterated over within a for loop. The variable item
is used to represent each element in the list as it’s being iterated over. In the first
iteration, item is 'vlan 10'; in the second iteration, item is ' name USERS'; and
so on.

Within the for loop, a list of dictionaries is ultimately created; each element in
the list is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: id and name. We accomplish this
by using a temporary dictionary called temp, adding both key-value pairs to it,
and then appending it to the final list only after appending the VLAN name. Per
the following note, temp is reinitialized only when it finds the next VLAN, so it’s
assuming a certain order of the input data.

Notice how strip() is being used. We can use strip() to strip not only white‐
space but also particular substrings within a string object. Additionally, we chain
multiple methods together in a single Python statement. For example, with the
value ' name WEB', when strip() is first used, it returns 'name WEB'. Then, we
use strip('name'), which returns ' WEB', and then finally strip() to remove
any whitespace that still remains to produce the final name of 'WEB'.

The previous example is not the only way to perform an operation
for reading in VLANs. That example assumes a VLAN ID and
name for every VLAN, which is usually not the case, but is done
this way for conveying certain concepts. It initializes temp only
when VLAN is found, and appends temp only after the “name” is
added (this would not work if a name did not exist for every
VLAN and is a good use case for using Python error handling
using try/except statements, as we cover in “Embracing Failure
with try/except” on page 234).

Writing to a File

The next example shows how to write data to a file. The vlans object created in the
previous example is used here too:

>>> vlans
[{'id': '10', 'name': 'USERS'}, {'id': '20', 'name': 'VOICE'},
{'id': '30', 'name': 'WLAN'}, {'id': '40', 'name': 'APP'},
{'id': '50', 'name': 'WEB'}, {'id': '60', 'name': 'DB'}]

A few more VLANs are created before you try to write the VLANs to a new file:

|
215


>>> add_vlan = {'id': '70', 'name': 'MISC'}
>>> vlans.append(add_vlan)
>>>
>>> add_vlan = {'id': '80', 'name': 'HQ'}
>>> vlans.append(add_vlan)
>>>
>>> print(vlans)
[{'id': '10', 'name': 'USERS'}, {'id': '20', 'name': 'VOICE'},
{'id': '30', 'name': 'WLAN'}, {'id': '40', 'name': 'APP'},
{'id': '50', 'name': 'WEB'}, {'id': '60', 'name': 'DB'},
{'id': '70', 'name': 'MISC'}, {'id': '80', 'name': 'HQ'}]

Eight VLANS are now in the vlans list. Let’s write them to a new file but keep the
formatting the way it should be with proper spacing.

The first step is to open the new file. If the file doesn’t exist, which it doesn’t in our
case, it’ll be created:

>>> write_file = open('vlans_new.cfg', 'w')

Once the file is open, you use the get() method again to extract the required VLAN
values from each dictionary and then use the file method called write() to write the
data to the file. Finally, you close the file:

>>> for vlan in vlans:
...
id = vlan.get('id')

...
name = vlan.get('name')

...
write_file.write(f'vlan {id}\n')

...
write_file.write(f'  name {name}\n')

...
>>>
>>> write_file.close()

You’ve created the vlans_new.cfg file and generated the following contents in the file:

$ cat vlans_new.cfg
vlan 10
  name USERS
vlan 20
  name VOICE
vlan 30
  name WLAN
vlan 40
  name APP
vlan 50
  name WEB
vlan 60
  name DB
vlan 70
  name MISC
vlan 80
  name HQ

Chapter 6: Python


As you start to use file objects more, you may see some interesting things happen. For
example, you may forget to close a file, and wonder why there is no data in the file
that you know should have data!

By default, what you are writing with the write() method is held
in a buffer and is written to the file only when the file is closed.
This setting is configurable.

You can also use the with statement, a context manager, to help manage this process.
A context manager is a Python object that defines a runtime context: what to do when
entering it and what to do when exiting it. In this example, you see how the return
object of the open() method is used as a context manager, so it closes the file when
exiting the context automatically:

>>> with open('vlans_new.cfg', 'w') as write_file:
...
write_file.write('vlan 10\n')

...
write_file.write('  name TEST_VLAN\n')

...

When you open a file with open('vlans.cfg', 'r'), two param‐
eters are passed. The first is the name of the file, including the
relative or absolute path of the file. The second is the mode, which
is an optional argument, but if not included, defaults to read-only,
which is the r mode. Other modes include w, which opens a file
only for writing (if you’re using the name of a file that already
exists, the contents are erased), a opens a file for appending, and r+
opens a file for reading and writing. You can find more details in
the official Python docs.

Since Python 3, the file’s content is handled as bytes and encoded
to text with an implicit UTF-8 encoding. If you want to change the
encoding type, you can use the named argument encoding:

>>> vlans_file = open('vlans.cfg', 'r', encoding='ascii')

Everything in this chapter thus far has been using the dynamic Python interpreter.
This showed how powerful the interpreter is for writing and testing new methods,
functions, or particular sections of your code. No matter how great the interpreter is,
you still need to be able to write programs and scripts that can run as a standalone
entity. This is exactly what we cover next.

Creating Python Programs

Let’s take a look at how to build on what you’ve been doing in the Python shell and
learn how to create and run a standalone Python script, or program. This section
shows how to easily take what you’ve learned so far and create a script within just a
few minutes.

If you’re following along, feel free to use any text editor you are
comfortable with, including, but not limited to vi, Vim, Sublime
Text, Notepad++, or even a full-blown IDE, such as PyCharm or
VS Code, as introduced in Chapter 5.

Let’s look at a few examples.

Creating a Basic Python Script

The first step is to create a new Python file that ends with the .py extension. From
the Linux terminal, you can create a new file by typing touch net_script.py and
opening it in your text editor. As expected, the file is completely empty.

The first script you’ll write simply prints text to the terminal. Add the following five
lines of text to net_script.py to create a basic Python script:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

if __name__ == "__main__":

print('^' * 30)
print('HELLO NETWORK AUTOMATION!!!!!')
print('^' * 30)

Now that the script is created, let’s execute it. To execute a Python script from the
Linux terminal, you use the python3 command. All you need to do is append the
script name to the command as shown here:

$ python3 net_script.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
HELLO NETWORK AUTOMATION!!!!!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And that’s it! If you were following along, you just created a Python script. You might
have noticed that everything under the if __name__ == "__main__": statement is
the same as if you were on the Python interpreter.

Now we’ll take a look at the two unique statements that are optional, but recom‐
mended, when you are writing Python scripts.

Chapter 6: Python


Using Comments in Python

Python code is usually easy to read, even without adding extra comments. However,
adding comments in your programs can sometimes help new developers jumping
into the code (reviewing, fixing or extending it), or even you, when you’re coming
back to your code after a while and don’t fully remember the original context.

This book isn’t about clean code best practices, but an accepted rule of thumb is that
comments should be used to explain or clarify your intent when it is not obvious
enough.

In Python you can use the # (known as a hashtag, number sign, or pound sign) for
inline comments:

commands = []
# The order of the commands is relevant, do not change it
commands.append(f'vlan {vlan}')
# Due to the naming convention, the name of a vlan includes the vlan ID
commands.append(f'name {name}_{vlan}')

Python linters used to perform checks on the code can also act upon the text that
comes after comments starting with #.

Now we’ll take a look at a special comment type, optional but recommended, when
you are writing Python scripts, the shebang. We introduced the shebang in Chapter 3.

Understanding the shebang

The shebang is the first line in the script: #!/usr/bin/env python3. This is a special
and unique line for Python programs.

It is the only line of code, other than comments, that uses the # as the first character.
The shebang needs to be the first line in a Python program when used.

The shebang instructs the system which Python interpreter to use to execute the
program. Of course, this also assumes file permissions are correct for your program
file (i.e., that the file is executable). If the shebang is not included, you must use the
python keyword to execute the script, which you have in all our examples anyway.

For example, say you have the following script in hello.py:

if __name__ == "__main__":

print('Hello Network Automation!')

You could execute the code by using the statement $ python3 hello.py, assuming
the file was saved as hello.py. But you could not execute it using the statement
$ ./hello.py. In order for the statement $ ./hello.py to be executed, you need to
add the shebang to the program file because that’s how the system knows how to
execute the script. Also, remember to add execute permissions to the file with chmod
+x hello.py!

Creating Python Programs
|
219


#!python3

if __name__ == "__main__":

print('Hello Network Automation!')

The shebang as we have it, python3, defaults to using Python 3.8.12 on the system
we’re using to write this book. We can check the exact Python version with which
python3:

$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3

If your machine has different installations of Python, you can refer directly to the
desired one in your shebang. For instance, using #!/usr/bin/python3.9 will use the
Python 3.9 executable. However, this approach has the drawback of being inflexible
(for instance, this will cause problems in Virtualenv, covered in “Isolating Your
Dependencies with Virtualenv” on page 229).

A better approach is to use /usr/bin/env python3, which allows the external envi‐
ronment to influence the specific installation your script uses.

Now that you understand the shebang, we can continue to present another optional
statement that will open the door to start creating your first Python scripts.

Migrating Code from the Python Interpreter to a Python Script

A common component of a Python script is the if __name__ == "__main__": state‐
ment. Based on the quotes, or lack thereof, you can see that __name__ is a variable,
and "__main__" is a string. When a Python file is executed as a standalone script,
the variable name __name__ is automatically set to "__main__". Thus, whenever you
use python3 script.py, everything underneath the if __name__ == "__main__":
statement is executed.

At this point, you are probably thinking, when wouldn’t __name__ be equal to
"__main__"? That is discussed in “Working with Python Modules” on page 222, but
here’s the short answer: when you are importing particular objects from Python files,
but not necessarily using those files as a standalone program.

In Example 6-6, we use the same Python script as in “Using Python Functions” on
page 209. The reason is to show you firsthand how easy it is to migrate from using the
Python interpreter to writing a standalone Python script.

Example 6-6. Script to render push commands

#!/usr/bin/env python3

def get_commands(vlan, name):

commands = []
commands.append(f'vlan {vlan}')
commands.append(f'name {name}')
return commands

def push_commands(device, commands):

print(f'Connecting to device: {device}')
for cmd in commands:

print(f'Sending command: {cmd}')

if __name__ == "__main__":

devices = ['switch1', 'switch2', 'switch3']

vlans = [

{'id': '10', 'name': 'USERS'},
{'id': '20', 'name': 'VOICE'},
{'id': '30', 'name': 'WLAN'}

]

for vlan in vlans:

vid = vlan.get('id')
name = vlan.get('name')
print(f'CONFIGURING VLAN: {vid}')
commands = get_commands(vid, name)
for device in devices:

push_commands(device, commands)
print()

The shebang instructs the system about the Python interpreter to use.

The functions are defined before using them.

The if statement indicates to run this code when it’s executed as a script instead
of being imported.

The same nested for loop defined in Example 6-4 is executed.

You can execute this script with the commands python3 push.py or ./push.py. The
output you see is exactly the same output you saw when it was executed on the
Python interpreter in Example 6-4.

Creating Python Programs

221


Python offers the -i flag to be used when executing a script, but
instead of exiting the script, it enters the interpreter, giving you
access to all the objects built in the script. This is great for testing.

Let’s see what happens when you run the script with the -i flag set:

$ python3 -i push.py
>>>
>>> print(devices)
['switch1', 'switch2', 'switch3']
>>>
>>> print(commands)
['vlan 30', 'name WLAN']

Notice that it executes, but then drops you right into the Python
shells and you have access to those objects at the end of the execu‐
tion. Pretty cool, right?

If you are creating several scripts that perform various configuration changes on
the network, you can intelligently assume that the push_commands() function will be
needed in almost all scripts. One option is to copy and paste the function into all the
scripts. Clearly, that would not be optimal because if you need to fix a bug in that
function, you would need to make that change in all the scripts.

Just as functions allow you to reuse code within a single script, Python provides
a way to reuse and share code among scripts/programs. You do so by creating a
Python module, which is what we cover next as we continue to build on the previous
example.

Working with Python Modules

We are going to continue to leverage the push.py file we just created in the previous
section to better articulate how to work with a Python module. You can think of a
module as a type of Python file that holds information, (e.g., Python objects), that can
be used by other Python programs but is not a standalone script or program itself.

For this example, you are going to enter back into the Python interpreter while in the
same directory where the push.py file exists.

Let’s assume you need to generate a new list of commands to send to a new list of
devices. Remember that you have this function called push_commands() in another
file that already has the logic to push a list of commands to a given device. Rather
than re-create the same function in your new program (or in the interpreter), you can
reuse push_commands() from within push.py. Let’s see how to do it.

222
|
Chapter 6: Python


While at the Python shell, you type in import push and hit Enter. This imports all the
objects within the push.py file:

>>> import push

Take a look at the imported objects by using dir(push):

>>> dir(push)
['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__',
'__package__', '__spec__', 'get_commands', 'push_commands']

Just as with the standard Python data types, push has methods that start and end
with underscores (dunders), but you should also notice the two objects called get_
commands and push_commands, which are the functions from the push.py file!

As you may recall, push_commands() requires two parameters. The first is a device,
and the second is a list of commands. Let’s now use push_commands() from the
interpreter:

>>> device = 'router1'
>>> commands = ['interface Eth1/1', 'shutdown']
>>>
>>> push.push_commands(device, commands)
Connecting to device: router1
Sending command: interface Eth1/1
Sending command: shutdown

If you import multiple modules, there could be objects with duplicated names. Using
import push is definitely a good option because it enables you to specify the module
where the object exists (i.e., push.push_commands). On the other hand, there are
other options for importing objects.

One other option is to use from import. In our example, it would look like this:
from push import push_commands. Notice in the following code, you can directly
use push_commands() without referencing push:

>>> from push import push_commands
>>>
>>> push_commands(device, commands)
Connecting to device: router1
Sending command: interface Eth1/1
Sending command: shutdown

We recommend making import statements as specific as possible
and to import only what’s used in your code. You should not use
wildcard imports, such as from push import *. Statements like
this load all objects from the module, potentially overloading and
causing namespace conflicts with objects you’ve defined. And it
also complicates troubleshooting, as it makes it difficult to decipher
where an object was defined or came from.

Working with Python Modules
|
223


Another option is to rename the object as you are importing it, using from import
as. If you happen to not like the name of the object or think it is too long, you can
rename it on import. The code looks like this for our example:

>>> from push import push_commands as pc
>>>
>>> pc(device, commands)
Connecting to device: router1
Sending command: interface Eth1/1
Sending command: shutdown

Notice how easy it is to rename the object and make it something shorter and/or
more intuitive.

Reusing functions is great, but it implies that the consumer of the code may not know
the concrete purpose, or usage, of the imported function. To make reusability easier,
the next step is to learn how to document your functions.

Documenting Functions

When you create functions that will be used by others, it’s helpful to document
how your function should be used. In Python, you can add docstrings to describe
functions, methods, and classes; you use triple quotes (""") to define a docstring, and
you can document the expected arguments and what the function returns:

def get_commands(vlan, name):

"""Get commands to configure a VLAN.

    Args:
        vlan (int): vlan id
        name (str): name of the vlan

    Returns:
        List of commands is returned.
    """

commands = []
commands.append(f'vlan {vlan}')
commands.append(f'name {name}')
return commands

You learned how to import a module—namely, push.py. Let’s import it again now
to see what happens when you use help on get_commands() since you now have a
docstring configured. You see the whole function’s docstring when you use help().
Additionally, you see information about the parameters and what data is returned, if
properly documented:

>>> import push
>>>
>>> help(push.get_commands)

Help on function get_commands in module push:

224
|
Chapter 6: Python


get_commands(vlan, name)

Get commands to configure a VLAN.

Args:

vlan (int): vlan id
name (str): name of the vlan

Returns:

List of commands is returned.

(END)

Some code editors provide contextual help to automatically render
the docstring information when you are typing a function name.

By now you should understand how to create not only a script, but also a Python
module with functions (and other objects), and how to use those reusable objects in
other scripts and programs.

Passing Arguments into a Python Script

The preceding two sections covered writing Python scripts and using Python mod‐
ules. The sys module is part of the Python standard library (i.e., comes with Python
by default), and now you will see how it allows you to easily pass in arguments from
the command line into a Python script. Specifically, you’re going to use an attribute
(or variable) within the module called argv.

Let’s take a look at a basic script called send_command.py that has only a single print
statement:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":

print(sys.argv)

sys.args is available only when running a Python script. It doesn’t
exist in the Python interpreter.

Now you’ll execute the script, passing in a few arguments simulating data required to
log in to a device and issue a show command:

Passing Arguments into a Python Script
|
225


ubuntu2004:~$ python3 send_command.py username password 10.1.10.10 "show version"
['send_command.py', 'username', 'password', '10.1.10.10', 'show version']

You can see that sys.argv is a list. In fact, it’s simply a list of the strings that you
passed in from the Linux command line. You can also infer what really happened:
Python did a split (str.split(" ")) on send-command.py username password
10.1.10.10 "show version", which created the list of five elements!

Finally, note that when you’re using sys.argv, the first element is always the script
name.

If you’d like, you can assign the value of sys.argv to an arbitrary variable to simplify
working with the parameters passed in. In either case, you can extract values by using
the appropriate index values as shown:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":

args = sys.argv
print(f"Username:  {args[1]}")
print(f"Password:  {args[2]}")
print(f"Device IP: {args[3]}")
print(f"Command:   {args[4]}")

If you execute this script, you get the following output:

$ python3 send_command.py username password 10.1.10.10 "show version"
Username:
username
Password:
password
Device IP: 10.1.10.10
Command:
show version

When using sys.argv, you still need to account for input error
handling (at a minimum, check the length of the list). Additionally,
the user of the script must know the precise order of the elements
that need to be passed in.

In our example, if you call the script with fewer than the four
expected arguments, you will hit an IndexError because you are
accessing an index in a list that doesn’t exist:

$ python3 send_command.py
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "/your/path/examples/ch06-python/send_command.py",
line 8, in <module> print(f"Username:  {args[1]}")

IndexError: list index out of range
For more advanced argument handling, you should look at the
Python module argparse, which offers a user-intuitive way of
passing in arguments with flags and a built-in help menu. This
is beyond the scope of this book.

Chapter 6: Python


You can build on this to perform more meaningful network tasks as you continue
reading this book. For example, after reading Chapter 10, you’ll be able to pass
parameters like this into a script that actually connects to a device and issues a show
command (or equivalent).

Using pip and Installing Python Packages

As you get started with Python, you’ll likely need to install third-party software.
For example, you may want to automate network devices with Netmiko, a popular
SSH client for Python that we cover in Chapter 10. The most common way to
distribute Python software, including Netmiko, is the Python Package Index (PyPI),
pronounced “pie-pie.” You can also browse and search the PyPI repository directly at
https://pypi.python.org/pypi.

pip, by default, installs the packages in the system. We strongly
recommend using virtual environments to isolate your Python
package installations. This topic is introduced next in “Isolating
Your Dependencies with Virtualenv” on page 229.

You can use the pip program to install any software that’s hosted on PyPI (such as
Netmiko) to your machine directly from PyPI. The pip installer by default goes to
PyPI, downloads the software, and installs it on your machine.

pip3, an updated version of the original pip from Python 2, installs
packages for Python 3+. Even though pip as a soft link could be
also pointing to pip3, to avoid ambiguity, we use pip3 consistently
in this book.

Using pip3 to install Netmiko can be done with a single line on your Linux machine:

ubuntu2004:~$ pip3 install netmiko
# output has been omitted

By default, this command will install the latest (stable release) of a given Python pack‐
age in a system path (the path will vary based on the OS). However, you may want
to ensure that you install a specific version—this is helpful so you don’t automatically
install the next release without testing. This is referred to as pinning: you can pin
your install to a specific release. In the next example, we show how you can pin the
installation of Netmiko to version 3.4.0:

ubuntu2004:~$ pip3 install netmiko==3.4.0
# output has been omitted

Using pip and Installing Python Packages

You can use pip3 to upgrade versions of the software too. For example, you may
have installed version 3.4.0 of Netmiko and when a new release is available, you can
upgrade to the latest release by using the --upgrade or -U flag on the command line:

ubuntu2004:~$ pip3 install netmiko --upgrade
# output has been omitted

It’s also common to install Python packages from source. That means getting a
specific version from the source code (not released to PyPI)—for example, from
GitHub, a version control system that we cover in Chapter 11. Perhaps the code
under development in GitHub has a bug fix you need, but it hasn’t been published.

When you get the source code of a Python project, there is a good chance you’ll see
two files in the root of the project: requirements.txt and setup.py. You can use these to
install the Python package from source. The requirements file lists the requirements
needed for the application to run. For example, here is the current requirements.txt
for Netmiko:

paramiko>=2.0.0
scp>=0.10.0
pyyaml
pyserial
textfsm

You can see that Netmiko has five dependencies, commonly referred to as deps. You
can also install these deps directly from PyPI by using a single statement:

ubuntu2004:~$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# output has been omitted

To completely install Netmiko (from source) including the requirements, you can
also execute the setup.py file that you’d see in the same source code directory:

ubuntu2004:~$ python3 setup.py install
# output has been omitted

By default, installing the software with setup.py will also install directly into a system
path. If you want to contribute back to a given project and actively develop the
project, you can also install the application directly from where the files exist and are
being developed:

ubuntu2004:~$ python3 setup.py develop
# output has been omitted

This makes it such that the files in your local directory are the ones running Netmiko.
Otherwise, with the install option, you’ll need to modify the files in your system
path to affect the Netmiko install (for example, when troubleshooting an external
library).

There is an even easier way to install a Python project from the
source code without cloning the repository locally. This approach
is especially useful when you don’t need to develop code but just
use a specific version, from a branch or a commit (see Chapter 11
for details). To target a specific branch, you can append @develop
after the repository URL. The name of the branch is develop, but
you could point to a specific commit or tag. This is particularly
useful when the library is still not released to PyPI or when you
want to use a feature that hasn’t been released yet:

ubuntu2004:~$ pip3 install \

git+https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko.git@develop

# output has been omitted

Isolating Your Dependencies with Virtualenv

By default, pip3 installs the packages into your global Python environment. This
works well for single-purpose applications (such as a container running one process),
but your local development environment is going to become a nightmare sooner
rather than later.

For example, when you work on your first Python project, say you install a specific
version of an external library. Then a new project comes up, and one of its dependen‐
cies depends on exactly the same library you already have, but on a different version.
Because pip3 installs the libraries globally, you have a problem.

But don’t worry; Python offers you a solution by creating virtual environments,
or virtualenvs. These isolated Python environments live inside a folder, with all
the dependencies of a specific project. This folder could be placed wherever you
prefer, and one common option is to put it directly in each project folder with the
name .venv.

To create a new Python virtualenv, you use python3 -m venv, followed by the folder
name. This command creates a brand-new Python environment in this folder, where
the packages will be installed:

ubuntu2004:~$ python3 -m venv .venv
ubuntu2004:~$ ls .venv
bin
include
lib
lib64
pyvenv.cfg

But so far, you have created only the virtualenv, and you are still not using it because
it’s not active. The next step is to activate it. Run source on bin/activate within
the virtualenv, and you will see how the path changes to (.venv), the name of your
virtualenv, indicating that now the Python environment is not the global one but the
one that has been activated. Now, if you check your Python binary path, it points to
the one within the .venv folder:

Using pip and Installing Python Packages
|
229


ubuntu2004:~$ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) ubuntu2004:~$
(.venv) ubuntu2004:~$ which python
/home/ntc/.venv/bin/python

Do you remember installing Netmiko before? If you check the installed packages
within the virtualenv, you won’t find it! Similarly, anything you install while the
virtualenv is activated is kept only on this virtualenv and won’t affect the global
environment or other virtualenvs:

(.venv) ubuntu2004:~$ pip3 list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        21.2.4
setuptools 57.5.0
wheel      0.37.1

Finally, you can go back to the global mode simply by deactivating the virtualenv:

(.venv) ubuntu2004:~$ deactivate
ubuntu2004:~$ which python
/usr/bin/python

Python has several packages (Pipenv, Poetry, and others) that can
help you with dependency management, installation, and packag‐
ing. We strongly recommend you give them a try; they are really
helpful!

As a best practice, keep every Python project in a different virtual environment. This
approach will make your life much easier because you will avoid the pain of inconsis‐
tent package versions, inherited from each project’s direct package dependencies.

Now that you have learned about installing and importing others’ code, and have
explored the Python built-in data types in “Understanding Python Data Types” on
page 172, the next stop is to understand how to define your own data types: classes.

Understanding Python Classes

A class, in a programming language, contains data (attributes) and procedures (meth‐
ods) that are related to its data. A class is one of the key abstractions that enable
object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python (and similarly in other programming
languages). OOP is about modeling real-world entities and how they interact; used
correctly, OOP can make your code more readable, maintainable, and even more
testable.

But, before going into defining your classes, you need to understand how to use
others’ defined classes.

230

Chapter 6: Python


Using Classes

To get access to classes from other modules, you use the same import statement you
used to import functions in “Working with Python Modules” on page 222. Here, you
import the class Device from your package vendors.cisco.device (from within the
ch6-python directory):

>>> from vendors.cisco.device import Device

Classes are just abstract representations of an object. However, to create a specific
instance of an object, you must instantiate the class. This looks similar to the way you
call functions, and you can think of this syntax as calling a function that returns an
instance of the class.

Then you can instantiate an instance of the Device class and get a Device object. As
with functions, you pass some arguments, which are used to construct the instance.
When you instantiate a class, you are actually calling the __init__() method, known
as the constructor. The following snippet describes how to create three objects from
the Device class and save them in different variables:

>>> switch1 = Device(ip='10.1.1.1', username='cisco', password='cisco')
>>> switch2 = Device(ip='10.1.1.2', username='cisco', password='cisco')
>>> switch3 = Device(ip='10.1.1.3', username='cisco', password='cisco')

Notice that each variable is a separate instance of Device:

>>> type(switch1)
<class 'vendors.cisco.device.Device'>

Once the class object is initialized, you can start using its methods. This is just like
using the built-in methods for the data types you learned about earlier in the chapter.
The syntax is class_object.method:

>>> switch1.show('show version')

As a reminder, using method objects of a class is just like using the
methods of the data types such as strings, lists, and dictionaries.

If you execute show for switch2 and switch3, you would get the proper return data
back from each device as expected, since each object is a different instance of Device,
and the show() method will use the connection data from each instance.

Now that you understand how to use classes, let’s create your first class!

Understanding Python Classes

Building Your Own Classes

In the previous section, we introduced two main elements you need to define when
building your own class:

• The constructor method (__init__()) to initialize the instance data (attributes)
•

• The methods that the objects of this class will expose
•

Taking as a reference the example from “Using Classes” on page 231, Example 6-7
implements the Device class, starting with the __init__() method.

Example 6-7. Building a class

>>> class Device:
...
def __init__(self, ip, username, password):

...
self.host_ip = ip

...
self.user = username

...
self.pswd = password

...
>>> router = Device(ip='192.0.2.1', username='abc', password='123')
>>>
>>> router.host_ip
'192.0.2.1'
>>>
>>> router.__dict__
{'host_ip': '192.0.2.1', 'user': 'abc', 'pswd': '123'}

With the class statement, you start the class definition (by convention, starting with
a capital letter, but that’s not mandatory).

And right after it, you define the __init__() constructor method (with def).
Remember that this method is a dunder that will be called, magically, when the class
is instantiated via Device(), returning an actual instance object. This newly created
object is referenced, within the method definition, by self. As you build more class
methods, you will use self to represent the instance of the class. However, self is
a convention, not an actual Python keyword. It is simply the first argument a class
method takes. In Example 6-7, the __init__() method stores only input arguments
into object attributes, but this method could contain a more complex logic.

After the class definition, you instantiate it and assign it to the router variable,
and then you access the data from one of its attributes with router.host_ip, simi‐
lar to the way you would call the methods that will expose later, but without the
parentheses.

Last, you access a hidden attribute, __dict__, that returns a default conversion of
all attributes as a dictionary. This could look like magic now because you have

232
|
Chapter 6: Python


not explicitly defined it, but you will understand when we explain inheritance in
Example 6-9.

Defining class methods is pretty similar to defining functions, but with the context
reference to self that points to the instance object created when the class is instanti‐
ated. See Example 6-8.

Example 6-8. Adding a method to a class

>>> class Device:
...
def __init__(self, ip, username, password):

...
# omitted for brevity

...
...
def show(self, command):

...
return f'{command} output from {self.host_ip}'

...
>>> router = Device(ip='192.0.2.1', username='abc', password='123')
>>>
>>> router.show('show version')
'show version output from 192.0.2.1'

The show() method, in the Device class, returns a string, combining an internal
class attribute, self.host_ip, and a method argument, command.

Class methods have access to the class instance object, via the first argument
(usually named self).

Sometimes you don’t need to completely create a brand-new class only to add a new
attribute or a new method. In these cases, it’s wiser to extend a class via inheritance.
We will not go deep on this topic, but Example 6-9 shows how simple is to extend
a class for your convenience while keeping the definition (attributes and methods)
from the parent class.

Example 6-9. Extending a class

>>> class Router(Device):
...
def disable_routing(self):

...
return f'Routing is disabled for {self.host_ip}'

...
>>>
>>> router = Router(ip='192.0.2.1', username='abc', password='123')
>>>
>>> router.show('show version')
'show version output from 192.0.2.1'
>>>
>>> router.disable_routing()
'Routing is disabled for 192.0.2.1'

233


We define the new class Router as in Example 6-7, but taking the argument
Device. At this point, Router is a copy of the original Device class, with a
different name.

After inheriting from a parent class, we can add new methods, as we do with
def disable_routing(self), or we can add other class attributes. Similarly as
we add a new method, we can overwrite a previously existing one by redefining it
in the child class.

The initialization of the router object (router = Router(...)) is exactly the
same as in Example 6-8, even though we have not defined a new __init__()
method.

The methods from the parent class are still available for the child objects.

Moreover, when an object is created from a class that inherits from another class, the
object belongs to all the classes. In our example, router is, at the same time, a Device
and a Router, as you can check with the isinstance() function:

>>> isinstance(router, Router)
True
>>> isinstance(router, Device)
True

We have barely touched the surface of Python classes, giving you the basics to start
using OOP in your programs. Next, you will learn how to make your code execution
more robust.

Embracing Failure with try/except

When you write code, you try to build it to provide a seamless execution, without
flow execution crashes. However, as the code grows in complexity, guaranteeing an
execution without errors becomes a big challenge because of the multiple cases to
cover.

Every programming language provides a pattern or mechanism to facilitate error
handling. In Python, error handling is built around exceptions (you’ve already seen
some of them, such as KeyError, in previous code examples) and the try/except
block.

Functions and methods communicate that something special has happened via rais‐
ing an exception. Python has a raise statement to enable your code to signal to the
caller of the function that a specific event has happened. Usually, this event is some‐
thing wrong and must be handled by the caller, but its meaning is not necessarily
negative.

234
|
Chapter 6: Python


From the caller’s perspective, you can use the try/except block to handle exceptions.
The try block is where the code is executed and exceptions may be raised, and the
except captures specific exceptions, in order to handle them appropriately.

When exploring the dictionaries access, you saw that a KeyError exception is raised
when you access a key that doesn’t exist. Now let’s try to not break the execution using
the try/except block:

>>> device = {'hostname': 'router1', 'vendor': 'juniper', 'os': '12.1'}
>>>
>>> device["random_key"]
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

KeyError: 'random_key'

Here, when you access random_key without the try/except block, a Traceback is
printed. This report contains where and how your code failed and broke the execu‐
tion, and is useful to diagnose the issue and debug your code. To better understand
the Traceback content, we should read it from the bottom up:

KeyError
Exception name raised.

'random_key'
The error message—in this case, the key that you are accessing.

File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
Calls involved, pointing out to the file and the line of code. In this case, because
we are using interactive mode, stdin is shown.

Now, using the try/except block, you make your code ready to handle the KeyError
exception gracefully, simply printing a message and resuming the code execution:

>>> try:
...
device["random_key"]

... except KeyError:
...
print('The key is not present')

...
The key is not present

Python has a built-in class Exception that is the parent of all the other exceptions.
Indeed, the KeyError exception inherits from Exception. Thus, you can use Excep
tion as a wildcard to catch all Python exceptions and protect your code execution
against any unexpected failure. However, use this with caution because it could mask
real programming errors.

Exception is yet another class, with certain dunders that make it special. All you
learned about classes still applies here, so you can create your own exceptions from
the base Exception class, overwriting methods or adding extra attributes, and catch

them in try/except blocks. When you build a Python library, the exception classes
have a relevant role too, besides the other functions and classes you expose.

Before closing this chapter, we want to explain a slightly more advanced concept to
introduce you to a new programming paradigm: parallel code execution.

Parallelizing Your Python Programs

By default, Python programs follow a serial execution pattern. Starting from an entry
point, your code is executed one task after another, so the second task doesn’t start
until the previous task is completed. This is not a problem when you have a small
program or when the time spent on each task is not significant. But what if one
task takes too long, simply waiting for an external process to complete? Should
your precious CPU stay empty until you get the response? Or, having multiple CPU
cores, why not distribute processing load across them, instead of leaving them on the
bench?

The solution to this challenge is performing multiple operations at the same time.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the difference between running your code tasks in serial or
running them in parallel.

Figure 6-1. Serial versus parallel execution

The most common network automation use cases, interacting with APIs or remote
network devices, are I/O-bound operations (entering a blocking state when waiting for
the input/output data). To parallelize these operations, you can use threads. A thread
is a separate flow of execution that runs at the same time.

236
|
Chapter 6: Python


Python supports multiple implementation options for parallelization. We don’t cover
all of them, but use the ThreadPoolExecutor utility to exemplify the idea.

For CPU-bound operations, where it’s necessary to spread the load
over multiple processes (instead of multiple threads on the same
process), you can use ProcessPoolExecutor, similarly to using
ThreadPoolExecutor here.

First, you simulate a long-standing I/O task adding a blocking call, time.sleep(5), in
the get_commands() function, the same function defined in Example 6-2:

>>> import time
>>>
>>> def get_commands(vlan, name):
...
time.sleep(5)

...
commands = []

...
commands.append(f'vlan {vlan}')

...
commands.append(f'name {name}')

...
return commands

...

As expected, in Example 6-10, if we execute the get_commands() function in a
three-iteration loop, the total execution time is 15 seconds, because each function is
called when the previous ends in a serial way.

Example 6-10. Serial execution

>>> def run_task(vlans):
...
start_time = time.time()

...
for vlan in vlans:

...
result = get_commands(vlan=vlan['id'], name=vlan['name'])

...
print(result)

...
print(f'Time spent: {time.time() - start_time} seconds')

...
>>> vlans = [{'id': '10', 'name': 'USERS'}, {'id': '20', 'name': 'VOICE'},
{'id': '30', 'name': 'WLAN'}]
>>>
>>> run_task(vlans)
['vlan 10', 'name USERS']
['vlan 20', 'name VOICE']
['vlan 30', 'name WLAN']
Time spent: 15.008316278457642 seconds

Wraps the loop into a run_task() function.

Prints the time spent subtracting the initial and final time, using the time.time()
function, which returns the time in seconds since the epoch.

Parallelizing Your Python Programs
|
237


Now, in Example 6-11, using ThreadPoolExecutor, the overall time spent is only
5 seconds instead of 15 seconds because the three tasks are executed concurrently.
Imagine what this means when you have to execute a 30-second operation for
hundreds of devices. Even though the code may look a bit overwhelming in the
beginning, we hope this sounds appealing to you.

Example 6-11. Parallel execution

>>> import concurrent.futures
>>>
>>> with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
...
start_time = time.time()

...
tasks = []

...
for vlan in vlans:

...
tasks.append(

...
executor.submit(

...
get_commands, vlan=vlan['id'], name=vlan['name']

...
)

...
)

...
for task in concurrent.futures.as_completed(tasks):

...
print(task.result())

...
print(f'Time spent: {time.time() - start_time} seconds')

...
['vlan 10', 'name USERS']
['vlan 20', 'name VOICE']
['vlan 30', 'name WLAN']
Time spent: 5.001068830490112 seconds

We introduce the ThreadPoolExecutor class, imported from concurrent
.futures, to implement concurrency running the same get_commands() func‐
tion. We use it as a context manager with the executor variable, automatically
cleaning up threads upon completion.

The first loop appends future tasks (using the executor).

The second iterates over these tasks, getting the results when completed.

This example helps illustrate the potential of using parallelization in Python. Getting
into the details of this code, or exploring other options, such as asyncio, are beyond
the scope of this book.

However, this paradigm introduces some collateral effects that must be taken into
account when building your code:

• When running code in parallel, by default, you don’t control the ending order of
•

the tasks. If your task’s execution has dependencies, some kind of coordination
will be needed (for instance, using semaphores).

238
|
Chapter 6: Python


• Depending on the parallelization approach, your functions may need to be
•

rewritten, slightly. For instance, you might need to adopt asynchronous behavior
when using the async/await pattern.

• Multiple tasks accessing the same memory object could cause data inconsistency.
•

For instance, two tasks could update the value of the same variable at the exact
same time. This can be solved using a locking mechanism, preventing concurrent
access.

• Increasing the number of parallel tasks, and running concurrent connections,
•

could overload the target endpoint if it’s not ready to handle so many sessions.
A good approach is to check the concurrency impact in the target endpoint,
progressively, so as to not completely knock it down.

Despite the previous considerations, running code in parallel, with the appropriate
design, can save a lot of time. With this last superpower, we end the Python chapter,
where you have hopefully gained the basic knowledge to start building your Python
applications.

Now, you are ready to start programming your first Python program, and as a bonus
point, we give you a simple trick to learn more about Python’s design philosophy. Try
import this and see what happens!

### Summary

This chapter provided a grassroots introduction to Python for network engineers.
We covered foundational concepts such as working with data types, conditionals,
loops, functions, and files, and even how to create a Python module that allows you
to reuse the same code in different Python programs/scripts. We also got into more
advanced topics such as classes and error handling, ending with a quick glance at
parallel execution. All these topics should help you as a reference as you continue on
with your Python and network automation journey.

In Chapter 8, we introduce you to data formats such as YAML, JSON, and XML, and
in that process, we also build on the content in this chapter. For example, you’ll take
what you learned and start to use Python modules to simplify the process of working
with these data types, and also see the direct correlation among YAML, JSON, and
Python dictionaries.

But Python is not the only programming language used in network automation.
Next, in Chapter 7, you will learn about another popular programming language for
automation (Go), and you will start noticing commonalities and differences.
