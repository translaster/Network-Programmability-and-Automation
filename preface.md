# Preface
Welcome to Network Programmability and Automation!
The networking industry is changing dramatically. The drive for organizations and
networking professionals to embrace the ideas and concepts of network programm‐
ability and automation is greater now than perhaps it has ever been, fueled by a
revolution in new protocols, new technologies, new delivery models, and a need
for businesses to be more agile and more flexible in order to compete. But what is
network programmability and automation? Let’s start this book by answering that
question.
## What This Book Covers
As its title indicates, this book is focused on network programmability and automa‐
tion. At its core, network programmability and automation is about simplifying the
tasks involved in configuring, managing, and operating network equipment, network
topologies, network services, and network connectivity.
Many, many components are involved—including operating systems that are now
seeing far broader use in networking than in the past, new methodologies like contin‐
uous integration, and tools that formerly might have fallen only in the realm of the
system administrator (tools like source code control and configuration management
systems). Because all of these play a part in the core definition of network programm‐
ability and automation, we cover all these topics. Our goal for this book is to enable
you to establish a foundation of knowledge around network programmability and
automation.
## What’s New in This Edition
This edition of the book has been updated from the original to include four totally
new chapters:
• Chapter 4, “Cloud”
• Chapter 5, “Network Developer Environments”
• Chapter 7, “Go”
• Chapter 14, “Network Automation Architecture”
We’ve also updated the existing chapters to include newer concepts such as these:
• Google Protocol Buffers
• gRPC/gNMI
• Terraform
• Nornir
On top of all these new additions, we’ve refreshed and extended every chapter to
reflect the advances and industry changes that have taken place since the first edition was published.
We’re thrilled to have the opportunity to add these new, exciting topics to the book.
Because of size constraints, some content from the first edition was not carried over into this one. However, rather than simply removing this content, we’ve made it freely available at https://oreilly-npa-book.github.io.
## How This Book Is Organized
This book isn’t necessarily intended to be read from start to end; instead, we’ve broken up the topics so that you can easily find the content that most interests you.
You may find it useful to start out sequentially reading the first three chapters, as they provide background information and set the stage for the rest of the book. From there, you’re welcome to jump to whatever topics are most useful or interesting to you.
We’ve tried to keep the chapters relatively standalone, but—as with any technology—that’s not always possible. Wherever we can, we provide cross-references to help you find the information you need.
PrefaceHere’s a quick look at how we’ve organized the topics:
*Chapter 1, “Network Industry Trends”*
Provides an overview of the major events and trends that launched software-
defined networking (SDN). As you’ll see, SDN was the genesis for an increased
focus on network programmability and automation.
*Chapter 2, “Network Automation”*
Takes the SDN discussion from Chapter 1 and focuses specifically on network
automation—the history of network automation, types of automation, tools and
technologies involved in automation, and how automation affects operational
models (and how operational models affect automation).
*Chapter 3, “Linux”*
Provides an overview of the Linux operating system. By no means a comprehen‐
sive discussion of Linux, this chapter aims to get networking professionals up to
speed on Linux, basic Linux commands, and Linux networking concepts.
*Chapter 4, “Cloud”*
Introduces cloud computing from a networking perspective, and provides a
jumping-off point for many relevant topics like containers and Kubernetes net‐
working. We also discuss how network engineers’ existing skills translate to a
cloud-based environment.
*Chapter 5, “Network Developer Environments”*
Explores the tools and techniques for maintaining a network developer environ‐
ment. This is a crucial part of any network automation project, and it allows
teams to collaborate on solutions more effectively, as well as efficiently move
from development to testing, all the way to production.
*Chapter 6, “Python”*
Introduces networking professionals to Python. This programming language is
frequently used in network programmability and automation contexts, and this
chapter covers many of the basics of programming with Python: data types,
conditionals, loops, working with files, functions, classes, and modules.
*Chapter 7, “Go”*
Adds a second option to the network automation professional’s programming
language repertoire, by exploring Go. Having recently grown in popularity—in
large part because of the cloud native ecosystem—Go is a valuable asset even for
those just starting on their automation journey.
*Chapter 8, “Data Formats and Models”*
Digs into the formats and methods for transmitting, storing, and modeling
network automation data. The ability to understand and work with data is a
fundamental skill for any network automation professional, and in this chapter,
we build a solid foundation for the chapters to follow.
*Chapter 9, “Templates”*
Looks at the use of templating languages to create network device configurations.
While the primary focus of this chapter is on the Jinja templating language, as
it integrates natively with Python, we also explore Go templates and Extensible
Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT).
*Chapter 10, “Working with Network APIs”*
Covers the role of APIs in network programmability and automation. We explore
key terms and technologies pertaining to APIs including HTTP, NETCONF,
RESTCONF, and gNMI as examples to show how they can be used for network
programmability and automation. We use both Python and Go libraries to auto‐
mate network devices using these APIs.
*Chapter 11, “Source Control with Git”*
Introduces Git, a popular and widely used tool for source code control. We
talk about why source code control is important, how it is used in a network
programmability and automation context, and how to work with popular online
services such as GitHub.
*Chapter 12, “Automation Tools”*
Explores the use of open source automation tools such as Ansible, Nornir with
NAPALM, and Terraform. You’ll learn how these tools can be used specifically
for network programmability and automation, using the imperative and declara‐
tive approaches.
*Chapter 13, “Continuous Integration”*
Examines continuous integration (CI) and the key tools and technologies that
are involved. We discuss the use of test-driven development (TDD), explore tools
and frameworks like GitLab and Jenkins, and take a look at a sample network
automation workflow that incorporates all these CI elements.
*Chapter 14, “Network Automation Architecture”*
Unifies all the concepts covered in prior chapters by proposing a reference architecture for a holistic network automation solution. Brings together automation and orchestration, explores the idea of a source of truth, and shows how user interactions might work in such a system.
### Who Should Read This Book
As we mentioned previously, the goal of this book is to equip you with foundational knowledge and a set of baseline skills in the areas of network programmability and automation. We believe that members of several IT disciplines will benefit from reading this book.
#### Network Engineers
Given the focus on network programmability and automation, it’s natural that one
audience for this book is the “traditional” network engineer, someone who is reasonably fluent in network protocols, configuring network devices, and operating and managing a network. You’ll learn how to use automation for configuration management, troubleshooting, observability, and more. This book will enable network engineers to be more efficient and to build more reliable infrastructure through automation and programmability.
##### Prerequisites
Network engineers interested in learning more about network programmability and
automation don’t need any previous knowledge in software development, program‐
ming, automation, or DevOps-related tools. The only prerequisite is an open mind
and a willingness to learn about new technologies and how they will affect you—the networking professional—and the greater networking industry as a whole.
#### Systems Administrators
Systems administrators, who are primarily responsible for managing the systems that connect to the network, may already have previous experience with some of the tools discussed in this book (notably, Linux, source code control, and configuration management systems). This book, then, could serve as a mechanism to help systems administrators expand their knowledge and understanding of such tools by presenting them in a different context (for example, using Ansible to configure a network switch as opposed to using Ansible to configure a server running a distribution of Linux).
##### Prerequisites
This book doesn’t provide any coverage or explanation of core networking proto‐
cols or concepts. However, as a result of managing network-connected systems, we
anticipate that many systems administrators also have a basic knowledge of core
networking protocols. So most experienced systems administrators should be fine.
If you’re a bit weak on your networking knowledge, we recommend supplementing
this book with one that focuses on core networking concepts and ideas. For example, Packet Guide to Core Network Protocols by Bruce Hartpence (O’Reilly) may be a good choice.
#### Software Developers
Software developers may also benefit from reading this book. Many developers will have prior experience with some of the programming languages and developer tools we discuss (such as Python and/or Git). Like systems administrators, developers may find it useful to see developer tools and languages used in a networking-centric context (for example, seeing how Python could be used to retrieve and store networkingspecific data).
##### Prerequisites
We do assume that you have a basic understanding of core network protocols and
concepts, and all the examples we provide are networking-centric examples. As with systems administrators, software developers who are new to networking will probably find it necessary to supplement the material in this book with a book that focuses on core networking concepts.
### Tools Used in This Book
As with any field of technology, the technologies and tools found in the network programmability and automation space have many versions and variations. Therefore, we standardized on a set of tools in this book that we feel best represents those you will find in the field. For example, Linux has many distributions, but we focus on only Debian, Ubuntu (which is itself a derivative of Debian), and CentOS (a derivative of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or RHEL). To help make it easy for you, we call out the specific version of the various tools in each tool’s specific chapter.
### Online Resources
We can’t possibly cover all the material we’d like to regarding network automation and network programmability. Therefore, throughout the book we reference additional online resources that you may find helpful in understanding the concepts and skills being presented.
